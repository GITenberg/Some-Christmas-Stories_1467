CHRISTMAS TREE.<br />
[1850]</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been looking on, this
evening, at a merry company of children assembled round that
pretty German toy, a Christmas Tree.&nbsp; The tree was planted
in the middle of a great round table, and towered high above
their heads.&nbsp; It was brilliantly lighted by a multitude of
little tapers; and everywhere sparkled and glittered with bright
objects.&nbsp; There were rosy-cheeked dolls, hiding behind the
green leaves; and there were real watches (with movable hands, at
least, and an endless capacity of being wound up) dangling from
innumerable twigs; there were French-polished tables, chairs,
bedsteads, wardrobes, eight-day clocks, and various other
articles of domestic furniture (wonderfully made, in tin, at
Wolverhampton), perched among the boughs, as if in preparation
for some fairy housekeeping; there were jolly, broad-faced little
men, much more agreeable in appearance than many real
men&mdash;and no wonder, for their heads took off, and showed
them to be full of sugar-plums; there were fiddles and drums;
there were tambourines, books, work-boxes, paint-boxes,
sweetmeat-boxes, peep-show boxes, and all kinds of boxes; there
were trinkets for the elder girls, far brighter than any grown-up
gold and jewels; there were baskets and pincushions in all
devices; there were guns, swords, and banners; there were witches
standing in enchanted rings of pasteboard, to tell fortunes;
there were teetotums, humming-tops, needle-cases, pen-wipers,
smelling-bottles, conversation-cards, bouquet-holders; real
fruit, made artificially dazzling with gold leaf; imitation
apples, pears, and walnuts, crammed with surprises; in short, as
a pretty child, before me, delightedly whispered to another
pretty child, her bosom friend, &ldquo;There was everything, and
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; This motley collection of odd objects,
clustering on the tree like magic fruit, and flashing back the
bright looks directed towards it from every side&mdash;some of
the diamond-eyes admiring it were hardly on a level with the
table, and a few were languishing in timid wonder on the bosoms
of pretty mothers, aunts, and nurses&mdash;made a lively
realisation of the fancies of childhood; and set me thinking how
all the trees that grow and all the things that come into
existence on the earth, have their wild adornments at that
well-remembered time.</p>
<p>Being now at home again, and alone, the only person in the
house awake, my thoughts are drawn back, by a fascination which I
do not care to resist, to my own childhood.&nbsp; I begin to
consider, what do we all remember best upon the branches of the
Christmas Tree of our own young Christmas days, by which we
climbed to real life.</p>
<p>Straight, in the middle of the room, cramped in the freedom of
its growth by no encircling walls or soon-reached ceiling, a
shadowy tree arises; and, looking up into the dreamy brightness
of its top&mdash;for I observe in this tree the singular property
that it appears to grow downward towards the earth&mdash;I look
into my youngest Christmas recollections!</p>
<p>All toys at first, I find.&nbsp; Up yonder, among the green
holly and red berries, is the Tumbler with his hands in his
pockets, who wouldn&rsquo;t lie down, but whenever he was put
upon the floor, persisted in rolling his fat body about, until he
rolled himself still, and brought those lobster eyes of his to
bear upon me&mdash;when I affected to laugh very much, but in my
heart of hearts was extremely doubtful of him.&nbsp; Close beside
him is that infernal snuff-box, out of which there sprang a
demoniacal Counsellor in a black gown, with an obnoxious head of
hair, and a red cloth mouth, wide open, who was not to be endured
on any terms, but could not be put away either; for he used
suddenly, in a highly magnified state, to fly out of Mammoth
Snuff-boxes in dreams, when least expected.&nbsp; Nor is the frog
with cobbler&rsquo;s wax on his tail, far off; for there was no
knowing where he wouldn&rsquo;t jump; and when he flew over the
candle, and came upon one&rsquo;s hand with that spotted
back&mdash;red on a green ground&mdash;he was horrible.&nbsp; The
cardboard lady in a blue-silk skirt, who was stood up against the
candlestick to dance, and whom I see on the same branch, was
milder, and was beautiful; but I can&rsquo;t say as much for the
larger cardboard man, who used to be hung against the wall and
pulled by a string; there was a sinister expression in that nose
of his; and when he got his legs round his neck (which he very
often did), he was ghastly, and not a creature to be alone
with.</p>
<p>When did that dreadful Mask first look at me?&nbsp; Who put it
on, and why was I so frightened that the sight of it is an era in
my life?&nbsp; It is not a hideous visage in itself; it is even
meant to be droll, why then were its stolid features so
intolerable?&nbsp; Surely not because it hid the wearer&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; An apron would have done as much; and though I should
have preferred even the apron away, it would not have been
absolutely insupportable, like the mask.&nbsp; Was it the
immovability of the mask?&nbsp; The doll&rsquo;s face was
immovable, but I was not afraid of <i>her</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps that
fixed and set change coming over a real face, infused into my
quickened heart some remote suggestion and dread of the universal
change that is to come on every face, and make it still?&nbsp;
Nothing reconciled me to it.&nbsp; No drummers, from whom
proceeded a melancholy chirping on the turning of a handle; no
regiment of soldiers, with a mute band, taken out of a box, and
fitted, one by one, upon a stiff and lazy little set of
lazy-tongs; no old woman, made of wires and a brown-paper
composition, cutting up a pie for two small children; could give
me a permanent comfort, for a long time.&nbsp; Nor was it any
satisfaction to be shown the Mask, and see that it was made of
paper, or to have it locked up and be assured that no one wore
it.&nbsp; The mere recollection of that fixed face, the mere
knowledge of its existence anywhere, was sufficient to awake me
in the night all perspiration and horror, with, &ldquo;O I know
it&rsquo;s coming!&nbsp; O the mask!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never wondered what the dear old donkey with the
panniers&mdash;there he is! was made of, then!&nbsp; His hide was
real to the touch, I recollect.&nbsp; And the great black horse
with the round red spots all over him&mdash;the horse that I
could even get upon&mdash;I never wondered what had brought him
to that strange condition, or thought that such a horse was not
commonly seen at Newmarket.&nbsp; The four horses of no colour,
next to him, that went into the waggon of cheeses, and could be
taken out and stabled under the piano, appear to have bits of
fur-tippet for their tails, and other bits for their manes, and
to stand on pegs instead of legs, but it was not so when they
were brought home for a Christmas present.&nbsp; They were all
right, then; neither was their harness unceremoniously nailed
into their chests, as appears to be the case now.&nbsp; The
tinkling works of the music-cart, I <i>did</i> find out, to be
made of quill tooth-picks and wire; and I always thought that
little tumbler in his shirt sleeves, perpetually swarming up one
side of a wooden frame, and coming down, head foremost, on the
other, rather a weak-minded person&mdash;though good-natured; but
the Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder, next him, made of little squares of red
wood, that went flapping and clattering over one another, each
developing a different picture, and the whole enlivened by small
bells, was a mighty marvel and a great delight.</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; The Doll&rsquo;s house!&mdash;of which I was not
proprietor, but where I visited.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t admire the
Houses of Parliament half so much as that stone-fronted mansion
with real glass windows, and door-steps, and a real
balcony&mdash;greener than I ever see now, except at watering
places; and even they afford but a poor imitation.&nbsp; And
though it <i>did</i> open all at once, the entire house-front
(which was a blow, I admit, as cancelling the fiction of a
staircase), it was but to shut it up again, and I could
believe.&nbsp; Even open, there were three distinct rooms in it:
a sitting-room and bed-room, elegantly furnished, and best of
all, a kitchen, with uncommonly soft fire-irons, a plentiful
assortment of diminutive utensils&mdash;oh, the
warming-pan!&mdash;and a tin man-cook in profile, who was always
going to fry two fish.&nbsp; What Barmecide justice have I done
to the noble feasts wherein the set of wooden platters figured,
each with its own peculiar delicacy, as a ham or turkey, glued
tight on to it, and garnished with something green, which I
recollect as moss!&nbsp; Could all the Temperance Societies of
these later days, united, give me such a tea-drinking as I have
had through the means of yonder little set of blue crockery,
which really would hold liquid (it ran out of the small wooden
cask, I recollect, and tasted of matches), and which made tea,
nectar.&nbsp; And if the two legs of the ineffectual little
sugar-tongs did tumble over one another, and want purpose, like
Punch&rsquo;s hands, what does it matter?&nbsp; And if I did once
shriek out, as a poisoned child, and strike the fashionable
company with consternation, by reason of having drunk a little
teaspoon, inadvertently dissolved in too hot tea, I was never the
worse for it, except by a powder!</p>
<p>Upon the next branches of the tree, lower down, hard by the
green roller and miniature gardening-tools, how thick the books
begin to hang.&nbsp; Thin books, in themselves, at first, but
many of them, and with deliciously smooth covers of bright red or
green.&nbsp; What fat black letters to begin with!&nbsp; &ldquo;A
was an archer, and shot at a frog.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course he
was.&nbsp; He was an apple-pie also, and there he is!&nbsp; He
was a good many things in his time, was A, and so were most of
his friends, except X, who had so little versatility, that I
never knew him to get beyond Xerxes or Xantippe&mdash;like Y, who
was always confined to a Yacht or a Yew Tree; and Z condemned for
ever to be a Zebra or a Zany.&nbsp; But, now, the very tree
itself changes, and becomes a bean-stalk&mdash;the marvellous
bean-stalk up which Jack climbed to the Giant&rsquo;s
house!&nbsp; And now, those dreadfully interesting, double-headed
giants, with their clubs over their shoulders, begin to stride
along the boughs in a perfect throng, dragging knights and ladies
home for dinner by the hair of their heads.&nbsp; And
Jack&mdash;how noble, with his sword of sharpness, and his shoes
of swiftness!&nbsp; Again those old meditations come upon me as I
gaze up at him; and I debate within myself whether there was more
than one Jack (which I am loth to believe possible), or only one
genuine original admirable Jack, who achieved all the recorded
exploits.</p>
<p>Good for Christmas-time is the ruddy colour of the cloak, in
which&mdash;the tree making a forest of itself for her to trip
through, with her basket&mdash;Little Red Riding-Hood comes to me
one Christmas Eve to give me information of the cruelty and
treachery of that dissembling Wolf who ate her grandmother,
without making any impression on his appetite, and then ate her,
after making that ferocious joke about his teeth.&nbsp; She was
my first love.&nbsp; I felt that if I could have married Little
Red Riding-Hood, I should have known perfect bliss.&nbsp; But, it
was not to be; and there was nothing for it but to look out the
Wolf in the Noah&rsquo;s Ark there, and put him late in the
procession on the table, as a monster who was to be
degraded.&nbsp; O the wonderful Noah&rsquo;s Ark!&nbsp; It was
not found seaworthy when put in a washing-tub, and the animals
were crammed in at the roof, and needed to have their legs well
shaken down before they could be got in, even there&mdash;and
then, ten to one but they began to tumble out at the door, which
was but imperfectly fastened with a wire latch&mdash;but what was
<i>that</i> against it!&nbsp; Consider the noble fly, a size or
two smaller than the elephant: the lady-bird, the
butterfly&mdash;all triumphs of art!&nbsp; Consider the goose,
whose feet were so small, and whose balance was so indifferent,
that he usually tumbled forward, and knocked down all the animal
creation.&nbsp; Consider Noah and his family, like idiotic
tobacco-stoppers; and how the leopard stuck to warm little
fingers; and how the tails of the larger animals used gradually
to resolve themselves into frayed bits of string!</p>
<p>Hush!&nbsp; Again a forest, and somebody up in a
tree&mdash;not Robin Hood, not Valentine, not the Yellow Dwarf (I
have passed him and all Mother Bunch&rsquo;s wonders, without
mention), but an Eastern King with a glittering scimitar and
turban.&nbsp; By Allah! two Eastern Kings, for I see another,
looking over his shoulder!&nbsp; Down upon the grass, at the
tree&rsquo;s foot, lies the full length of a coal-black Giant,
stretched asleep, with his head in a lady&rsquo;s lap; and near
them is a glass box, fastened with four locks of shining steel,
in which he keeps the lady prisoner when he is awake.&nbsp; I see
the four keys at his girdle now.&nbsp; The lady makes signs to
the two kings in the tree, who softly descend.&nbsp; It is the
setting-in of the bright Arabian Nights.</p>
<p>Oh, now all common things become uncommon and enchanted to
me.&nbsp; All lamps are wonderful; all rings are talismans.&nbsp;
Common flower-pots are full of treasure, with a little earth
scattered on the top; trees are for Ali Baba to hide in;
beef-steaks are to throw down into the Valley of Diamonds, that
the precious stones may stick to them, and be carried by the
eagles to their nests, whence the traders, with loud cries, will
scare them.&nbsp; Tarts are made, according to the recipe of the
Vizier&rsquo;s son of Bussorah, who turned pastrycook after he
was set down in his drawers at the gate of Damascus; cobblers are
all Mustaphas, and in the habit of sewing up people cut into four
pieces, to whom they are taken blind-fold.</p>
<p>Any iron ring let into stone is the entrance to a cave which
only waits for the magician, and the little fire, and the
necromancy, that will make the earth shake.&nbsp; All the dates
imported come from the same tree as that unlucky date, with whose
shell the merchant knocked out the eye of the genie&rsquo;s
invisible son.&nbsp; All olives are of the stock of that fresh
fruit, concerning which the Commander of the Faithful overheard
the boy conduct the fictitious trial of the fraudulent olive
merchant; all apples are akin to the apple purchased (with two
others) from the Sultan&rsquo;s gardener for three sequins, and
which the tall black slave stole from the child.&nbsp; All dogs
are associated with the dog, really a transformed man, who jumped
upon the baker&rsquo;s counter, and put his paw on the piece of
bad money.&nbsp; All rice recalls the rice which the awful lady,
who was a ghoule, could only peck by grains, because of her
nightly feasts in the burial-place.&nbsp; My very
rocking-horse,&mdash;there he is, with his nostrils turned
completely inside-out, indicative of Blood!&mdash;should have a
peg in his neck, by virtue thereof to fly away with me, as the
wooden horse did with the Prince of Persia, in the sight of all
his father&rsquo;s Court.</p>
<p>Yes, on every object that I recognise among those upper
branches of my Christmas Tree, I see this fairy light!&nbsp; When
I wake in bed, at daybreak, on the cold, dark, winter mornings,
the white snow dimly beheld, outside, through the frost on the
window-pane, I hear Dinarzade.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sister, sister, if
you are yet awake, I pray you finish the history of the Young
King of the Black Islands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scheherazade replies,
&ldquo;If my lord the Sultan will suffer me to live another day,
sister, I will not only finish that, but tell you a more
wonderful story yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, the gracious Sultan goes
out, giving no orders for the execution, and we all three breathe
again.</p>
<p>At this height of my tree I begin to see, cowering among the
leaves&mdash;it may be born of turkey, or of pudding, or mince
pie, or of these many fancies, jumbled with Robinson Crusoe on
his desert island, Philip Quarll among the monkeys, Sandford and
Merton with Mr. Barlow, Mother Bunch, and the Mask&mdash;or it
may be the result of indigestion, assisted by imagination and
over-doctoring&mdash;a prodigious nightmare.&nbsp; It is so
exceedingly indistinct, that I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s
frightful&mdash;but I know it is.&nbsp; I can only make out that
it is an immense array of shapeless things, which appear to be
planted on a vast exaggeration of the lazy-tongs that used to
bear the toy soldiers, and to be slowly coming close to my eyes,
and receding to an immeasurable distance.&nbsp; When it comes
closest, it is worse.&nbsp; In connection with it I descry
remembrances of winter nights incredibly long; of being sent
early to bed, as a punishment for some small offence, and waking
in two hours, with a sensation of having been asleep two nights;
of the laden hopelessness of morning ever dawning; and the
oppression of a weight of remorse.</p>
<p>And now, I see a wonderful row of little lights rise smoothly
out of the ground, before a vast green curtain.&nbsp; Now, a bell
rings&mdash;a magic bell, which still sounds in my ears unlike
all other bells&mdash;and music plays, amidst a buzz of voices,
and a fragrant smell of orange-peel and oil.&nbsp; Anon, the
magic bell commands the music to cease, and the great green
curtain rolls itself up majestically, and The Play begins!&nbsp;
The devoted dog of Montargis avenges the death of his master,
foully murdered in the Forest of Bondy; and a humorous Peasant
with a red nose and a very little hat, whom I take from this hour
forth to my bosom as a friend (I think he was a Waiter or an
Hostler at a village Inn, but many years have passed since he and
I have met), remarks that the sassigassity of that dog is indeed
surprising; and evermore this jocular conceit will live in my
remembrance fresh and unfading, overtopping all possible jokes,
unto the end of time.&nbsp; Or now, I learn with bitter tears how
poor Jane Shore, dressed all in white, and with her brown hair
hanging down, went starving through the streets; or how George
Barnwell killed the worthiest uncle that ever man had, and was
afterwards so sorry for it that he ought to have been let
off.&nbsp; Comes swift to comfort me, the
Pantomime&mdash;stupendous Phenomenon!&mdash;when clowns are shot
from loaded mortars into the great chandelier, bright
constellation that it is; when Harlequins, covered all over with
scales of pure gold, twist and sparkle, like amazing fish; when
Pantaloon (whom I deem it no irreverence to compare in my own
mind to my grandfather) puts red-hot pokers in his pocket, and
cries &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody coming!&rdquo; or taxes the
Clown with petty larceny, by saying, &ldquo;Now, I sawed you do
it!&rdquo; when Everything is capable, with the greatest ease, of
being changed into Anything; and &ldquo;Nothing is, but thinking
makes it so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, too, I perceive my first
experience of the dreary sensation&mdash;often to return in
after-life&mdash;of being unable, next day, to get back to the
dull, settled world; of wanting to live for ever in the bright
atmosphere I have quitted; of doting on the little Fairy, with
the wand like a celestial Barber&rsquo;s Pole, and pining for a
Fairy immortality along with her.&nbsp; Ah, she comes back, in
many shapes, as my eye wanders down the branches of my Christmas
Tree, and goes as often, and has never yet stayed by me!</p>
<p>Out of this delight springs the toy-theatre,&mdash;there it
is, with its familiar proscenium, and ladies in feathers, in the
boxes!&mdash;and all its attendant occupation with paste and
glue, and gum, and water colours, in the getting-up of The Miller
and his Men, and Elizabeth, or the Exile of Siberia.&nbsp; In
spite of a few besetting accidents and failures (particularly an
unreasonable disposition in the respectable Kelmar, and some
others, to become faint in the legs, and double up, at exciting
points of the drama), a teeming world of fancies so suggestive
and all-embracing, that, far below it on my Christmas Tree, I see
dark, dirty, real Theatres in the day-time, adorned with these
associations as with the freshest garlands of the rarest flowers,
and charming me yet.</p>
<p>But hark!&nbsp; The Waits are playing, and they break my
childish sleep!&nbsp; What images do I associate with the
Christmas music as I see them set forth on the Christmas
Tree?&nbsp; Known before all the others, keeping far apart from
all the others, they gather round my little bed.&nbsp; An angel,
speaking to a group of shepherds in a field; some travellers,
with eyes uplifted, following a star; a baby in a manger; a child
in a spacious temple, talking with grave men; a solemn figure,
with a mild and beautiful face, raising a dead girl by the hand;
again, near a city gate, calling back the son of a widow, on his
bier, to life; a crowd of people looking through the opened roof
of a chamber where he sits, and letting down a sick person on a
bed, with ropes; the same, in a tempest, walking on the water to
a ship; again, on a sea-shore, teaching a great multitude; again,
with a child upon his knee, and other children round; again,
restoring sight to the blind, speech to the dumb, hearing to the
deaf, health to the sick, strength to the lame, knowledge to the
ignorant; again, dying upon a Cross, watched by armed soldiers, a
thick darkness coming on, the earth beginning to shake, and only
one voice heard, &ldquo;Forgive them, for they know not what they
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, on the lower and maturer branches of the Tree,
Christmas associations cluster thick.&nbsp; School-books shut up;
Ovid and Virgil silenced; the Rule of Three, with its cool
impertinent inquiries, long disposed of; Terence and Plautus
acted no more, in an arena of huddled desks and forms, all
chipped, and notched, and inked; cricket-bats, stumps, and balls,
left higher up, with the smell of trodden grass and the softened
noise of shouts in the evening air; the tree is still fresh,
still gay.&nbsp; If I no more come home at Christmas-time, there
will be boys and girls (thank Heaven!) while the World lasts; and
they do!&nbsp; Yonder they dance and play upon the branches of my
Tree, God bless them, merrily, and my heart dances and plays
too!</p>
<p>And I do come home at Christmas.&nbsp; We all do, or we all
should.&nbsp; We all come home, or ought to come home, for a
short holiday&mdash;the longer, the better&mdash;from the great
boarding-school, where we are for ever working at our
arithmetical slates, to take, and give a rest.&nbsp; As to going
a visiting, where can we not go, if we will; where have we not
been, when we would; starting our fancy from our Christmas
Tree!</p>
<p>Away into the winter prospect.&nbsp; There are many such upon
the tree!&nbsp; On, by low-lying, misty grounds, through fens and
fogs, up long hills, winding dark as caverns between thick
plantations, almost shutting out the sparkling stars; so, out on
broad heights, until we stop at last, with sudden silence, at an
avenue.&nbsp; The gate-bell has a deep, half-awful sound in the
frosty air; the gate swings open on its hinges; and, as we drive
up to a great house, the glancing lights grow larger in the
windows, and the opposing rows of trees seem to fall solemnly
back on either side, to give us place.&nbsp; At intervals, all
day, a frightened hare has shot across this whitened turf; or the
distant clatter of a herd of deer trampling the hard frost, has,
for the minute, crushed the silence too.&nbsp; Their watchful
eyes beneath the fern may be shining now, if we could see them,
like the icy dewdrops on the leaves; but they are still, and all
is still.&nbsp; And so, the lights growing larger, and the trees
falling back before us, and closing up again behind us, as if to
forbid retreat, we come to the house.</p>
<p>There is probably a smell of roasted chestnuts and other good
comfortable things all the time, for we are telling Winter
Stories&mdash;Ghost Stories, or more shame for us&mdash;round the
Christmas fire; and we have never stirred, except to draw a
little nearer to it.&nbsp; But, no matter for that.&nbsp; We came
to the house, and it is an old house, full of great chimneys
where wood is burnt on ancient dogs upon the hearth, and grim
portraits (some of them with grim legends, too) lower
distrustfully from the oaken panels of the walls.&nbsp; We are a
middle-aged nobleman, and we make a generous supper with our host
and hostess and their guests&mdash;it being Christmas-time, and
the old house full of company&mdash;and then we go to bed.&nbsp;
Our room is a very old room.&nbsp; It is hung with
tapestry.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t like the portrait of a cavalier in
green, over the fireplace.&nbsp; There are great black beams in
the ceiling, and there is a great black bedstead, supported at
the foot by two great black figures, who seem to have come off a
couple of tombs in the old baronial church in the park, for our
particular accommodation.&nbsp; But, we are not a superstitious
nobleman, and we don&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; Well! we dismiss our
servant, lock the door, and sit before the fire in our
dressing-gown, musing about a great many things.&nbsp; At length
we go to bed.&nbsp; Well! we can&rsquo;t sleep.&nbsp; We toss and
tumble, and can&rsquo;t sleep.&nbsp; The embers on the hearth
burn fitfully and make the room look ghostly.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t help peeping out over the counterpane, at the two
black figures and the cavalier&mdash;that wicked-looking
cavalier&mdash;in green.&nbsp; In the flickering light they seem
to advance and retire: which, though we are not by any means a
superstitious nobleman, is not agreeable.&nbsp; Well! we get
nervous&mdash;more and more nervous.&nbsp; We say &ldquo;This is
very foolish, but we can&rsquo;t stand this; we&rsquo;ll pretend
to be ill, and knock up somebody.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well! we are just
going to do it, when the locked door opens, and there comes in a
young woman, deadly pale, and with long fair hair, who glides to
the fire, and sits down in the chair we have left there, wringing
her hands.&nbsp; Then, we notice that her clothes are wet.&nbsp;
Our tongue cleaves to the roof of our mouth, and we can&rsquo;t
speak; but, we observe her accurately.&nbsp; Her clothes are wet;
her long hair is dabbled with moist mud; she is dressed in the
fashion of two hundred years ago; and she has at her girdle a
bunch of rusty keys.&nbsp; Well! there she sits, and we
can&rsquo;t even faint, we are in such a state about it.&nbsp;
Presently she gets up, and tries all the locks in the room with
the rusty keys, which won&rsquo;t fit one of them; then, she
fixes her eyes on the portrait of the cavalier in green, and
says, in a low, terrible voice, &ldquo;The stags know
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; After that, she wrings her hands again, passes
the bedside, and goes out at the door.&nbsp; We hurry on our
dressing-gown, seize our pistols (we always travel with pistols),
and are following, when we find the door locked.&nbsp; We turn
the key, look out into the dark gallery; no one there.&nbsp; We
wander away, and try to find our servant.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t be
done.&nbsp; We pace the gallery till daybreak; then return to our
deserted room, fall asleep, and are awakened by our servant
(nothing ever haunts him) and the shining sun.&nbsp; Well! we
make a wretched breakfast, and all the company say we look
queer.&nbsp; After breakfast, we go over the house with our host,
and then we take him to the portrait of the cavalier in green,
and then it all comes out.&nbsp; He was false to a young
housekeeper once attached to that family, and famous for her
beauty, who drowned herself in a pond, and whose body was
discovered, after a long time, because the stags refused to drink
of the water.&nbsp; Since which, it has been whispered that she
traverses the house at midnight (but goes especially to that room
where the cavalier in green was wont to sleep), trying the old
locks with the rusty keys.&nbsp; Well! we tell our host of what
we have seen, and a shade comes over his features, and he begs it
may be hushed up; and so it is.&nbsp; But, it&rsquo;s all true;
and we said so, before we died (we are dead now) to many
responsible people.</p>
<p>There is no end to the old houses, with resounding galleries,
and dismal state-bedchambers, and haunted wings shut up for many
years, through which we may ramble, with an agreeable creeping up
our back, and encounter any number of ghosts, but (it is worthy
of remark perhaps) reducible to a very few general types and
classes; for, ghosts have little originality, and
&ldquo;walk&rdquo; in a beaten track.&nbsp; Thus, it comes to
pass, that a certain room in a certain old hall, where a certain
bad lord, baronet, knight, or gentleman, shot himself, has
certain planks in the floor from which the blood <i>will not</i>
be taken out.&nbsp; You may scrape and scrape, as the present
owner has done, or plane and plane, as his father did, or scrub
and scrub, as his grandfather did, or burn and burn with strong
acids, as his great-grandfather did, but, there the blood will
still be&mdash;no redder and no paler&mdash;no more and no
less&mdash;always just the same.&nbsp; Thus, in such another
house there is a haunted door, that never will keep open; or
another door that never will keep shut, or a haunted sound of a
spinning-wheel, or a hammer, or a footstep, or a cry, or a sigh,
or a horse&rsquo;s tramp, or the rattling of a chain.&nbsp; Or
else, there is a turret-clock, which, at the midnight hour,
strikes thirteen when the head of the family is going to die; or
a shadowy, immovable black carriage which at such a time is
always seen by somebody, waiting near the great gates in the
stable-yard.&nbsp; Or thus, it came to pass how Lady Mary went to
pay a visit at a large wild house in the Scottish Highlands, and,
being fatigued with her long journey, retired to bed early, and
innocently said, next morning, at the breakfast-table, &ldquo;How
odd, to have so late a party last night, in this remote place,
and not to tell me of it, before I went to bed!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, every one asked Lady Mary what she meant?&nbsp; Then, Lady
Mary replied, &ldquo;Why, all night long, the carriages were
driving round and round the terrace, underneath my
window!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, the owner of the house turned pale,
and so did his Lady, and Charles Macdoodle of Macdoodle signed to
Lady Mary to say no more, and every one was silent.&nbsp; After
breakfast, Charles Macdoodle told Lady Mary that it was a
tradition in the family that those rumbling carriages on the
terrace betokened death.&nbsp; And so it proved, for, two months
afterwards, the Lady of the mansion died.&nbsp; And Lady Mary,
who was a Maid of Honour at Court, often told this story to the
old Queen Charlotte; by this token that the old King always said,
&ldquo;Eh, eh?&nbsp; What, what?&nbsp; Ghosts, ghosts?&nbsp; No
such thing, no such thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; And never left off saying
so, until he went to bed.</p>
<p>Or, a friend of somebody&rsquo;s whom most of us know, when he
was a young man at college, had a particular friend, with whom he
made the compact that, if it were possible for the Spirit to
return to this earth after its separation from the body, he of
the twain who first died, should reappear to the other.&nbsp; In
course of time, this compact was forgotten by our friend; the two
young men having progressed in life, and taken diverging paths
that were wide asunder.&nbsp; But, one night, many years
afterwards, our friend being in the North of England, and staying
for the night in an inn, on the Yorkshire Moors, happened to look
out of bed; and there, in the moonlight, leaning on a bureau near
the window, steadfastly regarding him, saw his old college
friend!&nbsp; The appearance being solemnly addressed, replied,
in a kind of whisper, but very audibly, &ldquo;Do not come near
me.&nbsp; I am dead.&nbsp; I am here to redeem my promise.&nbsp;
I come from another world, but may not disclose its
secrets!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, the whole form becoming paler,
melted, as it were, into the moonlight, and faded away.</p>
<p>Or, there was the daughter of the first occupier of the
picturesque Elizabethan house, so famous in our
neighbourhood.&nbsp; You have heard about her?&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
Why, <i>She</i> went out one summer evening at twilight, when she
was a beautiful girl, just seventeen years of age, to gather
flowers in the garden; and presently came running, terrified,
into the hall to her father, saying, &ldquo;Oh, dear father, I
have met myself!&rdquo;&nbsp; He took her in his arms, and told
her it was fancy, but she said, &ldquo;Oh no!&nbsp; I met myself
in the broad walk, and I was pale and gathering withered flowers,
and I turned my head, and held them up!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, that
night, she died; and a picture of her story was begun, though
never finished, and they say it is somewhere in the house to this
day, with its face to the wall.</p>
<p>Or, the uncle of my brother&rsquo;s wife was riding home on
horseback, one mellow evening at sunset, when, in a green lane
close to his own house, he saw a man standing before him, in the
very centre of a narrow way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why does that man in
the cloak stand there!&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he
want me to ride over him?&rdquo;&nbsp; But the figure never
moved.&nbsp; He felt a strange sensation at seeing it so still,
but slackened his trot and rode forward.&nbsp; When he was so
close to it, as almost to touch it with his stirrup, his horse
shied, and the figure glided up the bank, in a curious, unearthly
manner&mdash;backward, and without seeming to use its
feet&mdash;and was gone.&nbsp; The uncle of my brother&rsquo;s
wife, exclaiming, &ldquo;Good Heaven!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my cousin
Harry, from Bombay!&rdquo; put spurs to his horse, which was
suddenly in a profuse sweat, and, wondering at such strange
behaviour, dashed round to the front of his house.&nbsp; There,
he saw the same figure, just passing in at the long French window
of the drawing-room, opening on the ground.&nbsp; He threw his
bridle to a servant, and hastened in after it.&nbsp; His sister
was sitting there, alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alice, where&rsquo;s my
cousin Harry?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your cousin Harry,
John?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; From Bombay.&nbsp; I met him
in the lane just now, and saw him enter here, this
instant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not a creature had been seen by any one;
and in that hour and minute, as it afterwards appeared, this
cousin died in India.</p>
<p>Or, it was a certain sensible old maiden lady, who died at
ninety-nine, and retained her faculties to the last, who really
did see the Orphan Boy; a story which has often been incorrectly
told, but, of which the real truth is this&mdash;because it is,
in fact, a story belonging to our family&mdash;and she was a
connexion of our family.&nbsp; When she was about forty years of
age, and still an uncommonly fine woman (her lover died young,
which was the reason why she never married, though she had many
offers), she went to stay at a place in Kent, which her brother,
an Indian-Merchant, had newly bought.&nbsp; There was a story
that this place had once been held in trust by the guardian of a
young boy; who was himself the next heir, and who killed the
young boy by harsh and cruel treatment.&nbsp; She knew nothing of
that.&nbsp; It has been said that there was a Cage in her bedroom
in which the guardian used to put the boy.&nbsp; There was no
such thing.&nbsp; There was only a closet.&nbsp; She went to bed,
made no alarm whatever in the night, and in the morning said
composedly to her maid when she came in, &ldquo;Who is the pretty
forlorn-looking child who has been peeping out of that closet all
night?&rdquo;&nbsp; The maid replied by giving a loud scream, and
instantly decamping.&nbsp; She was surprised; but she was a woman
of remarkable strength of mind, and she dressed herself and went
downstairs, and closeted herself with her brother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, Walter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have been disturbed
all night by a pretty, forlorn-looking boy, who has been
constantly peeping out of that closet in my room, which I
can&rsquo;t open.&nbsp; This is some trick.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am afraid not, Charlotte,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for it is the
legend of the house.&nbsp; It is the Orphan Boy.&nbsp; What did
he do?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He opened the door softly,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;and peeped out.&nbsp; Sometimes, he came a step or
two into the room.&nbsp; Then, I called to him, to encourage him,
and he shrunk, and shuddered, and crept in again, and shut the
door.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The closet has no communication,
Charlotte,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;with any other part of
the house, and it&rsquo;s nailed up.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
undeniably true, and it took two carpenters a whole forenoon to
get it open, for examination.&nbsp; Then, she was satisfied that
she had seen the Orphan Boy.&nbsp; But, the wild and terrible
part of the story is, that he was also seen by three of her
brother&rsquo;s sons, in succession, who all died young.&nbsp; On
the occasion of each child being taken ill, he came home in a
heat, twelve hours before, and said, Oh, Mamma, he had been
playing under a particular oak-tree, in a certain meadow, with a
strange boy&mdash;a pretty, forlorn-looking boy, who was very
timid, and made signs!&nbsp; From fatal experience, the parents
came to know that this was the Orphan Boy, and that the course of
that child whom he chose for his little playmate was surely
run.</p>
<p>Legion is the name of the German castles, where we sit up
alone to wait for the Spectre&mdash;where we are shown into a
room, made comparatively cheerful for our reception&mdash;where
we glance round at the shadows, thrown on the blank walls by the
crackling fire&mdash;where we feel very lonely when the village
innkeeper and his pretty daughter have retired, after laying down
a fresh store of wood upon the hearth, and setting forth on the
small table such supper-cheer as a cold roast capon, bread,
grapes, and a flask of old Rhine wine&mdash;where the
reverberating doors close on their retreat, one after another,
like so many peals of sullen thunder&mdash;and where, about the
small hours of the night, we come into the knowledge of divers
supernatural mysteries.&nbsp; Legion is the name of the haunted
German students, in whose society we draw yet nearer to the fire,
while the schoolboy in the corner opens his eyes wide and round,
and flies off the footstool he has chosen for his seat, when the
door accidentally blows open.&nbsp; Vast is the crop of such
fruit, shining on our Christmas Tree; in blossom, almost at the
very top; ripening all down the boughs!</p>
<p>Among the later toys and fancies hanging there&mdash;as idle
often and less pure&mdash;be the images once associated with the
sweet old Waits, the softened music in the night, ever
unalterable!&nbsp; Encircled by the social thoughts of
Christmas-time, still let the benignant figure of my childhood
stand unchanged!&nbsp; In every cheerful image and suggestion
that the season brings, may the bright star that rested above the
poor roof, be the star of all the Christian World!&nbsp; A
moment&rsquo;s pause, O vanishing tree, of which the lower boughs
are dark to me as yet, and let me look once more!&nbsp; I know
there are blank spaces on thy branches, where eyes that I have
loved have shone and smiled; from which they are departed.&nbsp;
But, far above, I see the raiser of the dead girl, and the
Widow&rsquo;s Son; and God is good!&nbsp; If Age be hiding for me
in the unseen portion of thy downward growth, O may I, with a
grey head, turn a child&rsquo;s heart to that figure yet, and a
child&rsquo;s trustfulness and confidence!</p>
<p>Now, the tree is decorated with bright merriment, and song,
and dance, and cheerfulness.&nbsp; And they are welcome.&nbsp;
Innocent and welcome be they ever held, beneath the branches of
the Christmas Tree, which cast no gloomy shadow!&nbsp; But, as it
sinks into the ground, I hear a whisper going through the
leaves.&nbsp; &ldquo;This, in commemoration of the law of love
and kindness, mercy and compassion.&nbsp; This, in remembrance of
Me!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>WHAT
CHRISTMAS IS AS WE GROW OLDER.<br />
[1851]</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> was, with most of us, when
Christmas Day encircling all our limited world like a magic ring,
left nothing out for us to miss or seek; bound together all our
home enjoyments, affections, and hopes; grouped everything and
every one around the Christmas fire; and made the little picture
shining in our bright young eyes, complete.</p>
<p>Time came, perhaps, all so soon, when our thoughts over-leaped
that narrow boundary; when there was some one (very dear, we
thought then, very beautiful, and absolutely perfect) wanting to
the fulness of our happiness; when we were wanting too (or we
thought so, which did just as well) at the Christmas hearth by
which that some one sat; and when we intertwined with every
wreath and garland of our life that some one&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>That was the time for the bright visionary Christmases which
have long arisen from us to show faintly, after summer rain, in
the palest edges of the rainbow!&nbsp; That was the time for the
beatified enjoyment of the things that were to be, and never
were, and yet the things that were so real in our resolute hope
that it would be hard to say, now, what realities achieved since,
have been stronger!</p>
<p>What!&nbsp; Did that Christmas never really come when we and
the priceless pearl who was our young choice were received, after
the happiest of totally impossible marriages, by the two united
families previously at daggers&mdash;drawn on our account?&nbsp;
When brothers and sisters-in-law who had always been rather cool
to us before our relationship was effected, perfectly doted on
us, and when fathers and mothers overwhelmed us with unlimited
incomes?&nbsp; Was that Christmas dinner never really eaten,
after which we arose, and generously and eloquently rendered
honour to our late rival, present in the company, then and there
exchanging friendship and forgiveness, and founding an
attachment, not to be surpassed in Greek or Roman story, which
subsisted until death?&nbsp; Has that same rival long ceased to
care for that same priceless pearl, and married for money, and
become usurious?&nbsp; Above all, do we really know, now, that we
should probably have been miserable if we had won and worn the
pearl, and that we are better without her?</p>
<p>That Christmas when we had recently achieved so much fame;
when we had been carried in triumph somewhere, for doing
something great and good; when we had won an honoured and
ennobled name, and arrived and were received at home in a shower
of tears of joy; is it possible that <i>that</i> Christmas has
not come yet?</p>
<p>And is our life here, at the best, so constituted that,
pausing as we advance at such a noticeable mile-stone in the
track as this great birthday, we look back on the things that
never were, as naturally and full as gravely as on the things
that have been and are gone, or have been and still are?&nbsp; If
it be so, and so it seems to be, must we come to the conclusion
that life is little better than a dream, and little worth the
loves and strivings that we crowd into it?</p>
<p>No!&nbsp; Far be such miscalled philosophy from us, dear
Reader, on Christmas Day!&nbsp; Nearer and closer to our hearts
be the Christmas spirit, which is the spirit of active
usefulness, perseverance, cheerful discharge of duty, kindness
and forbearance!&nbsp; It is in the last virtues especially, that
we are, or should be, strengthened by the unaccomplished visions
of our youth; for, who shall say that they are not our teachers
to deal gently even with the impalpable nothings of the
earth!</p>
<p>Therefore, as we grow older, let us be more thankful that the
circle of our Christmas associations and of the lessons that they
bring, expands!&nbsp; Let us welcome every one of them, and
summon them to take their places by the Christmas hearth.</p>
<p>Welcome, old aspirations, glittering creatures of an ardent
fancy, to your shelter underneath the holly!&nbsp; We know you,
and have not outlived you yet.&nbsp; Welcome, old projects and
old loves, however fleeting, to your nooks among the steadier
lights that burn around us.&nbsp; Welcome, all that was ever real
to our hearts; and for the earnestness that made you real, thanks
to Heaven!&nbsp; Do we build no Christmas castles in the clouds
now?&nbsp; Let our thoughts, fluttering like butterflies among
these flowers of children, bear witness!&nbsp; Before this boy,
there stretches out a Future, brighter than we ever looked on in
our old romantic time, but bright with honour and with
truth.&nbsp; Around this little head on which the sunny curls lie
heaped, the graces sport, as prettily, as airily, as when there
was no scythe within the reach of Time to shear away the curls of
our first-love.&nbsp; Upon another girl&rsquo;s face near
it&mdash;placider but smiling bright&mdash;a quiet and contented
little face, we see Home fairly written.&nbsp; Shining from the
word, as rays shine from a star, we see how, when our graves are
old, other hopes than ours are young, other hearts than ours are
moved; how other ways are smoothed; how other happiness blooms,
ripens, and decays&mdash;no, not decays, for other homes and
other bands of children, not yet in being nor for ages yet to be,
arise, and bloom and ripen to the end of all!</p>
<p>Welcome, everything!&nbsp; Welcome, alike what has been, and
what never was, and what we hope may be, to your shelter
underneath the holly, to your places round the Christmas fire,
where what is sits open-hearted!&nbsp; In yonder shadow, do we
see obtruding furtively upon the blaze, an enemy&rsquo;s
face?&nbsp; By Christmas Day we do forgive him!&nbsp; If the
injury he has done us may admit of such companionship, let him
come here and take his place.&nbsp; If otherwise, unhappily, let
him go hence, assured that we will never injure nor accuse
him.</p>
<p>On this day we shut out Nothing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pause,&rdquo; says a low voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing?&nbsp; Think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Christmas Day, we will shut out from our fireside,
Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the shadow of a vast City where the withered leaves
are lying deep?&rdquo; the voice replies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not the
shadow that darkens the whole globe?&nbsp; Not the shadow of the
City of the Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not even that.&nbsp; Of all days in the year, we will turn our
faces towards that City upon Christmas Day, and from its silent
hosts bring those we loved, among us.&nbsp; City of the Dead, in
the blessed name wherein we are gathered together at this time,
and in the Presence that is here among us according to the
promise, we will receive, and not dismiss, thy people who are
dear to us!</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; We can look upon these children angels that alight,
so solemnly, so beautifully among the living children by the
fire, and can bear to think how they departed from us.&nbsp;
Entertaining angels unawares, as the Patriarchs did, the playful
children are unconscious of their guests; but we can see
them&mdash;can see a radiant arm around one favourite neck, as if
there were a tempting of that child away.&nbsp; Among the
celestial figures there is one, a poor misshapen boy on earth, of
a glorious beauty now, of whom his dying mother said it grieved
her much to leave him here, alone, for so many years as it was
likely would elapse before he came to her&mdash;being such a
little child.&nbsp; But he went quickly, and was laid upon her
breast, and in her hand she leads him.</p>
<p>There was a gallant boy, who fell, far away, upon a burning
sand beneath a burning sun, and said, &ldquo;Tell them at home,
with my last love, how much I could have wished to kiss them
once, but that I died contented and had done my
duty!&rdquo;&nbsp; Or there was another, over whom they read the
words, &ldquo;Therefore we commit his body to the deep,&rdquo;
and so consigned him to the lonely ocean and sailed on.&nbsp; Or
there was another, who lay down to his rest in the dark shadow of
great forests, and, on earth, awoke no more.&nbsp; O shall they
not, from sand and sea and forest, be brought home at such a
time!</p>
<p>There was a dear girl&mdash;almost a woman&mdash;never to be
one&mdash;who made a mourning Christmas in a house of joy, and
went her trackless way to the silent City.&nbsp; Do we recollect
her, worn out, faintly whispering what could not be heard, and
falling into that last sleep for weariness?&nbsp; O look upon her
now!&nbsp; O look upon her beauty, her serenity, her changeless
youth, her happiness!&nbsp; The daughter of Jairus was recalled
to life, to die; but she, more blest, has heard the same voice,
saying unto her, &ldquo;Arise for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had a friend who was our friend from early days, with whom
we often pictured the changes that were to come upon our lives,
and merrily imagined how we would speak, and walk, and think, and
talk, when we came to be old.&nbsp; His destined habitation in
the City of the Dead received him in his prime.&nbsp; Shall he be
shut out from our Christmas remembrance?&nbsp; Would his love
have so excluded us?&nbsp; Lost friend, lost child, lost parent,
sister, brother, husband, wife, we will not so discard you!&nbsp;
You shall hold your cherished places in our Christmas hearts, and
by our Christmas fires; and in the season of immortal hope, and
on the birthday of immortal mercy, we will shut out Nothing!</p>
<p>The winter sun goes down over town and village; on the sea it
makes a rosy path, as if the Sacred tread were fresh upon the
water.&nbsp; A few more moments, and it sinks, and night comes
on, and lights begin to sparkle in the prospect.&nbsp; On the
hill-side beyond the shapelessly-diffused town, and in the quiet
keeping of the trees that gird the village-steeple, remembrances
are cut in stone, planted in common flowers, growing in grass,
entwined with lowly brambles around many a mound of earth.&nbsp;
In town and village, there are doors and windows closed against
the weather, there are flaming logs heaped high, there are joyful
faces, there is healthy music of voices.&nbsp; Be all
ungentleness and harm excluded from the temples of the Household
Gods, but be those remembrances admitted with tender
encouragement!&nbsp; They are of the time and all its comforting
and peaceful reassurances; and of the history that re-united even
upon earth the living and the dead; and of the broad beneficence
and goodness that too many men have tried to tear to narrow
shreds.</p>
<h2><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>THE
POOR RELATION&rsquo;S STORY.<br />
[1852]</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was very reluctant to take
precedence of so many respected members of the family, by
beginning the round of stories they were to relate as they sat in
a goodly circle by the Christmas fire; and he modestly suggested
that it would be more correct if &ldquo;John our esteemed
host&rdquo; (whose health he begged to drink) would have the
kindness to begin.&nbsp; For as to himself, he said, he was so
little used to lead the way that really&mdash;&nbsp; But as they
all cried out here, that he must begin, and agreed with one voice
that he might, could, would, and should begin, he left off
rubbing his hands, and took his legs out from under his armchair,
and did begin.</p>
<p>I have no doubt (said the poor relation) that I shall surprise
the assembled members of our family, and particularly John our
esteemed host to whom we are so much indebted for the great
hospitality with which he has this day entertained us, by the
confession I am going to make.&nbsp; But, if you do me the honour
to be surprised at anything that falls from a person so
unimportant in the family as I am, I can only say that I shall be
scrupulously accurate in all I relate.</p>
<p>I am not what I am supposed to be.&nbsp; I am quite another
thing.&nbsp; Perhaps before I go further, I had better glance at
what I <i>am</i> supposed to be.</p>
<p>It is supposed, unless I mistake&mdash;the assembled members
of our family will correct me if I do, which is very likely (here
the poor relation looked mildly about him for contradiction);
that I am nobody&rsquo;s enemy but my own.&nbsp; That I never met
with any particular success in anything.&nbsp; That I failed in
business because I was unbusiness-like and credulous&mdash;in not
being prepared for the interested designs of my partner.&nbsp;
That I failed in love, because I was ridiculously
trustful&mdash;in thinking it impossible that Christiana could
deceive me.&nbsp; That I failed in my expectations from my uncle
Chill, on account of not being as sharp as he could have wished
in worldly matters.&nbsp; That, through life, I have been rather
put upon and disappointed in a general way.&nbsp; That I am at
present a bachelor of between fifty-nine and sixty years of age,
living on a limited income in the form of a quarterly allowance,
to which I see that John our esteemed host wishes me to make no
further allusion.</p>
<p>The supposition as to my present pursuits and habits is to the
following effect.</p>
<p>I live in a lodging in the Clapham Road&mdash;a very clean
back room, in a very respectable house&mdash;where I am expected
not to be at home in the day-time, unless poorly; and which I
usually leave in the morning at nine o&rsquo;clock, on pretence
of going to business.&nbsp; I take my breakfast&mdash;my roll and
butter, and my half-pint of coffee&mdash;at the old-established
coffee-shop near Westminster Bridge; and then I go into the
City&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why&mdash;and sit in
Garraway&rsquo;s Coffee House, and on &rsquo;Change, and walk
about, and look into a few offices and counting-houses where some
of my relations or acquaintance are so good as to tolerate me,
and where I stand by the fire if the weather happens to be
cold.&nbsp; I get through the day in this way until five
o&rsquo;clock, and then I dine: at a cost, on the average, of one
and threepence.&nbsp; Having still a little money to spend on my
evening&rsquo;s entertainment, I look into the old-established
coffee-shop as I go home, and take my cup of tea, and perhaps my
bit of toast.&nbsp; So, as the large hand of the clock makes its
way round to the morning hour again, I make my way round to the
Clapham Road again, and go to bed when I get to my
lodging&mdash;fire being expensive, and being objected to by the
family on account of its giving trouble and making a dirt.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one of my relations or acquaintances is so obliging
as to ask me to dinner.&nbsp; Those are holiday occasions, and
then I generally walk in the Park.&nbsp; I am a solitary man, and
seldom walk with anybody.&nbsp; Not that I am avoided because I
am shabby; for I am not at all shabby, having always a very good
suit of black on (or rather Oxford mixture, which has the
appearance of black and wears much better); but I have got into a
habit of speaking low, and being rather silent, and my spirits
are not high, and I am sensible that I am not an attractive
companion.</p>
<p>The only exception to this general rule is the child of my
first cousin, Little Frank.&nbsp; I have a particular affection
for that child, and he takes very kindly to me.&nbsp; He is a
diffident boy by nature; and in a crowd he is soon run over, as I
may say, and forgotten.&nbsp; He and I, however, get on
exceedingly well.&nbsp; I have a fancy that the poor child will
in time succeed to my peculiar position in the family.&nbsp; We
talk but little; still, we understand each other.&nbsp; We walk
about, hand in hand; and without much speaking he knows what I
mean, and I know what he means.&nbsp; When he was very little
indeed, I used to take him to the windows of the toy-shops, and
show him the toys inside.&nbsp; It is surprising how soon he
found out that I would have made him a great many presents if I
had been in circumstances to do it.</p>
<p>Little Frank and I go and look at the outside of the
Monument&mdash;he is very fond of the Monument&mdash;and at the
Bridges, and at all the sights that are free.&nbsp; On two of my
birthdays, we have dined on &agrave;-la-mode beef, and gone at
half-price to the play, and been deeply interested.&nbsp; I was
once walking with him in Lombard Street, which we often visit on
account of my having mentioned to him that there are great riches
there&mdash;he is very fond of Lombard Street&mdash;when a
gentleman said to me as he passed by, &ldquo;Sir, your little son
has dropped his glove.&rdquo;&nbsp; I assure you, if you will
excuse my remarking on so trivial a circumstance, this accidental
mention of the child as mine, quite touched my heart and brought
the foolish tears into my eyes.</p>
<p>When Little Frank is sent to school in the country, I shall be
very much at a loss what to do with myself, but I have the
intention of walking down there once a month and seeing him on a
half holiday.&nbsp; I am told he will then be at play upon the
Heath; and if my visits should be objected to, as unsettling the
child, I can see him from a distance without his seeing me, and
walk back again.&nbsp; His mother comes of a highly genteel
family, and rather disapproves, I am aware, of our being too much
together.&nbsp; I know that I am not calculated to improve his
retiring disposition; but I think he would miss me beyond the
feeling of the moment if we were wholly separated.</p>
<p>When I die in the Clapham Road, I shall not leave much more in
this world than I shall take out of it; but, I happen to have a
miniature of a bright-faced boy, with a curling head, and an open
shirt-frill waving down his bosom (my mother had it taken for me,
but I can&rsquo;t believe that it was ever like), which will be
worth nothing to sell, and which I shall beg may he given to
Frank.&nbsp; I have written my dear boy a little letter with it,
in which I have told him that I felt very sorry to part from him,
though bound to confess that I knew no reason why I should remain
here.&nbsp; I have given him some short advice, the best in my
power, to take warning of the consequences of being
nobody&rsquo;s enemy but his own; and I have endeavoured to
comfort him for what I fear he will consider a bereavement, by
pointing out to him, that I was only a superfluous something to
every one but him; and that having by some means failed to find a
place in this great assembly, I am better out of it.</p>
<p>Such (said the poor relation, clearing his throat and
beginning to speak a little louder) is the general impression
about me.&nbsp; Now, it is a remarkable circumstance which forms
the aim and purpose of my story, that this is all wrong.&nbsp;
This is not my life, and these are not my habits.&nbsp; I do not
even live in the Clapham Road.&nbsp; Comparatively speaking, I am
very seldom there.&nbsp; I reside, mostly, in a&mdash;I am almost
ashamed to say the word, it sounds so full of pretension&mdash;in
a Castle.&nbsp; I do not mean that it is an old baronial
habitation, but still it is a building always known to every one
by the name of a Castle.&nbsp; In it, I preserve the particulars
of my history; they run thus:</p>
<p>It was when I first took John Spatter (who had been my clerk)
into partnership, and when I was still a young man of not more
than five-and-twenty, residing in the house of my uncle Chill,
from whom I had considerable expectations, that I ventured to
propose to Christiana.&nbsp; I had loved Christiana a long
time.&nbsp; She was very beautiful, and very winning in all
respects.&nbsp; I rather mistrusted her widowed mother, who I
feared was of a plotting and mercenary turn of mind; but, I
thought as well of her as I could, for Christiana&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; I never had loved any one but Christiana, and she had
been all the world, and O far more than all the world, to me,
from our childhood!</p>
<p>Christiana accepted me with her mother&rsquo;s consent, and I
was rendered very happy indeed.&nbsp; My life at my uncle
Chill&rsquo;s was of a spare dull kind, and my garret chamber was
as dull, and bare, and cold, as an upper prison room in some
stern northern fortress.&nbsp; But, having Christiana&rsquo;s
love, I wanted nothing upon earth.&nbsp; I would not have changed
my lot with any human being.</p>
<p>Avarice was, unhappily, my uncle Chill&rsquo;s
master-vice.&nbsp; Though he was rich, he pinched, and scraped,
and clutched, and lived miserably.&nbsp; As Christiana had no
fortune, I was for some time a little fearful of confessing our
engagement to him; but, at length I wrote him a letter, saying
how it all truly was.&nbsp; I put it into his hand one night, on
going to bed.</p>
<p>As I came down-stairs next morning, shivering in the cold
December air; colder in my uncle&rsquo;s unwarmed house than in
the street, where the winter sun did sometimes shine, and which
was at all events enlivened by cheerful faces and voices passing
along; I carried a heavy heart towards the long, low
breakfast-room in which my uncle sat.&nbsp; It was a large room
with a small fire, and there was a great bay window in it which
the rain had marked in the night as if with the tears of
houseless people.&nbsp; It stared upon a raw yard, with a cracked
stone pavement, and some rusted iron railings half uprooted,
whence an ugly out-building that had once been a dissecting-room
(in the time of the great surgeon who had mortgaged the house to
my uncle), stared at it.</p>
<p>We rose so early always, that at that time of the year we
breakfasted by candle-light.&nbsp; When I went into the room, my
uncle was so contracted by the cold, and so huddled together in
his chair behind the one dim candle, that I did not see him until
I was close to the table.</p>
<p>As I held out my hand to him, he caught up his stick (being
infirm, he always walked about the house with a stick), and made
a blow at me, and said, &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect
you to be so angry as this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor had I expected it,
though he was a hard and angry old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;when
did you ever expect?&nbsp; When did you ever calculate, or look
forward, you contemptible dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are hard words, uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard words?&nbsp; Feathers, to pelt such an idiot as
you with,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here!&nbsp; Betsy
Snap!&nbsp; Look at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betsy Snap was a withered, hard-favoured, yellow old
woman&mdash;our only domestic&mdash;always employed, at this time
of the morning, in rubbing my uncle&rsquo;s legs.&nbsp; As my
uncle adjured her to look at me, he put his lean grip on the
crown of her head, she kneeling beside him, and turned her face
towards me.&nbsp; An involuntary thought connecting them both
with the Dissecting Room, as it must often have been in the
surgeon&rsquo;s time, passed across my mind in the midst of my
anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the snivelling milksop!&rdquo; said my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at the baby!&nbsp; This is the gentleman
who, people say, is nobody&rsquo;s enemy but his own.&nbsp; This
is the gentleman who can&rsquo;t say no.&nbsp; This is the
gentleman who was making such large profits in his business that
he must needs take a partner, t&rsquo;other day.&nbsp; This is
the gentleman who is going to marry a wife without a penny, and
who falls into the hands of Jezabels who are speculating on my
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew, now, how great my uncle&rsquo;s rage was; for nothing
short of his being almost beside himself would have induced him
to utter that concluding word, which he held in such repugnance
that it was never spoken or hinted at before him on any
account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my death,&rdquo; he repeated, as if he were defying
me by defying his own abhorrence of the word.&nbsp; &ldquo;On my
death&mdash;death&mdash;Death!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll spoil the
speculation.&nbsp; Eat your last under this roof, you feeble
wretch, and may it choke you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may suppose that I had not much appetite for the breakfast
to which I was bidden in these terms; but, I took my accustomed
seat.&nbsp; I saw that I was repudiated henceforth by my uncle;
still I could bear that very well, possessing Christiana&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>He emptied his basin of bread and milk as usual, only that he
took it on his knees with his chair turned away from the table
where I sat.&nbsp; When he had done, he carefully snuffed out the
candle; and the cold, slate-coloured, miserable day looked in
upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Michael,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;before we
part, I should like to have a word with these ladies in your
presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will, sir,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;but you
deceive yourself, and wrong us, cruelly, if you suppose that
there is any feeling at stake in this contract but pure,
disinterested, faithful love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this, he only replied, &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; and not one
other word.</p>
<p>We went, through half-thawed snow and half-frozen rain, to the
house where Christiana and her mother lived.&nbsp; My uncle knew
them very well.&nbsp; They were sitting at their breakfast, and
were surprised to see us at that hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said my uncle to the
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You divine the purpose of my visit, I dare
say, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I understand there is a world of pure,
disinterested, faithful love cooped up here.&nbsp; I am happy to
bring it all it wants, to make it complete.&nbsp; I bring you
your son-in-law, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;and you, your husband,
miss.&nbsp; The gentleman is a perfect stranger to me, but I wish
him joy of his wise bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snarled at me as he went out, and I never saw him
again.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is altogether a mistake (continued the poor relation) to
suppose that my dear Christiana, over-persuaded and influenced by
her mother, married a rich man, the dirt from whose carriage
wheels is often, in these changed times, thrown upon me as she
rides by.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; She married me.</p>
<p>The way we came to be married rather sooner than we intended,
was this.&nbsp; I took a frugal lodging and was saving and
planning for her sake, when, one day, she spoke to me with great
earnestness, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Michael, I have given you my heart.&nbsp; I
have said that I loved you, and I have pledged myself to be your
wife.&nbsp; I am as much yours through all changes of good and
evil as if we had been married on the day when such words passed
between us.&nbsp; I know you well, and know that if we should be
separated and our union broken off, your whole life would be
shadowed, and all that might, even now, be stronger in your
character for the conflict with the world would then be weakened
to the shadow of what it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help me, Christiana!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael!&rdquo; said she, putting her hand in mine, in
all maidenly devotion, &ldquo;let us keep apart no longer.&nbsp;
It is but for me to say that I can live contented upon such means
as you have, and I well know you are happy.&nbsp; I say so from
my heart.&nbsp; Strive no more alone; let us strive
together.&nbsp; My dear Michael, it is not right that I should
keep secret from you what you do not suspect, but what distresses
my whole life.&nbsp; My mother: without considering that what you
have lost, you have lost for me, and on the assurance of my
faith: sets her heart on riches, and urges another suit upon me,
to my misery.&nbsp; I cannot bear this, for to bear it is to be
untrue to you.&nbsp; I would rather share your struggles than
look on.&nbsp; I want no better home than you can give me.&nbsp;
I know that you will aspire and labour with a higher courage if I
am wholly yours, and let it be so when you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was blest indeed, that day, and a new world opened to
me.&nbsp; We were married in a very little while, and I took my
wife to our happy home.&nbsp; That was the beginning of the
residence I have spoken of; the Castle we have ever since
inhabited together, dates from that time.&nbsp; All our children
have been born in it.&nbsp; Our first child&mdash;now
married&mdash;was a little girl, whom we called Christiana.&nbsp;
Her son is so like Little Frank, that I hardly know which is
which.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The current impression as to my partner&rsquo;s dealings with
me is also quite erroneous.&nbsp; He did not begin to treat me
coldly, as a poor simpleton, when my uncle and I so fatally
quarrelled; nor did he afterwards gradually possess himself of
our business and edge me out.&nbsp; On the contrary, he behaved
to me with the utmost good faith and honour.</p>
<p>Matters between us took this turn:&mdash;On the day of my
separation from my uncle, and even before the arrival at our
counting-house of my trunks (which he sent after me, <i>not</i>
carriage paid), I went down to our room of business, on our
little wharf, overlooking the river; and there I told John
Spatter what had happened.&nbsp; John did not say, in reply, that
rich old relatives were palpable facts, and that love and
sentiment were moonshine and fiction.&nbsp; He addressed me
thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;we were at school
together, and I generally had the knack of getting on better than
you, and making a higher reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had, John,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I borrowed your books
and lost them; borrowed your pocket-money, and never repaid it;
got you to buy my damaged knives at a higher price than I had
given for them new; and to own to the windows that I had
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All not worth mentioning, John Spatter,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but certainly true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you were first established in this infant
business, which promises to thrive so well,&rdquo; pursued John,
&ldquo;I came to you, in my search for almost any employment, and
you made me your clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still not worth mentioning, my dear John
Spatter,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;still, equally true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And finding that I had a good head for business, and
that I was really useful <i>to</i> the business, you did not like
to retain me in that capacity, and thought it an act of justice
soon to make me your partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still less worth mentioning than any of those other
little circumstances you have recalled, John Spatter,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;for I was, and am, sensible of your merits and my
deficiencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my good friend,&rdquo; said John, drawing my arm
through his, as he had had a habit of doing at school; while two
vessels outside the windows of our counting-house&mdash;which
were shaped like the stern windows of a ship&mdash;went lightly
down the river with the tide, as John and I might then be sailing
away in company, and in trust and confidence, on our voyage of
life; &ldquo;let there, under these friendly circumstances, be a
right understanding between us.&nbsp; You are too easy,
Michael.&nbsp; You are nobody&rsquo;s enemy but your own.&nbsp;
If I were to give you that damaging character among our
connexion, with a shrug, and a shake of the head, and a sigh; and
if I were further to abuse the trust you place in
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never will abuse it at all, John,&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I am putting a
case&mdash;I say, and if I were further to abuse that trust by
keeping this piece of our common affairs in the dark, and this
other piece in the light, and again this other piece in the
twilight, and so on, I should strengthen my strength, and weaken
your weakness, day by day, until at last I found myself on the
high road to fortune, and you left behind on some bare common, a
hopeless number of miles out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To prevent this, Michael,&rdquo; said John Spatter,
&ldquo;or the remotest chance of this, there must be perfect
openness between us.&nbsp; Nothing must be concealed, and we must
have but one interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear John Spatter,&rdquo; I assured him, &ldquo;that
is precisely what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you are too easy,&rdquo; pursued John, his
face glowing with friendship, &ldquo;you must allow me to prevent
that imperfection in your nature from being taken advantage of,
by any one; you must not expect me to humour it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear John Spatter,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> expect you to humour it.&nbsp; I want to
correct it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, too,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so!&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We both have
the same end in view; and, honourably seeking it, and fully
trusting one another, and having but one interest, ours will be a
prosperous and happy partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it!&rdquo; returned John Spatter.&nbsp;
And we shook hands most affectionately.</p>
<p>I took John home to my Castle, and we had a very happy
day.&nbsp; Our partnership throve well.&nbsp; My friend and
partner supplied what I wanted, as I had foreseen that he would,
and by improving both the business and myself, amply acknowledged
any little rise in life to which I had helped him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am not (said the poor relation, looking at the fire as he
slowly rubbed his hands) very rich, for I never cared to be that;
but I have enough, and am above all moderate wants and
anxieties.&nbsp; My Castle is not a splendid place, but it is
very comfortable, and it has a warm and cheerful air, and is
quite a picture of Home.</p>
<p>Our eldest girl, who is very like her mother, married John
Spatter&rsquo;s eldest son.&nbsp; Our two families are closely
united in other ties of attachment.&nbsp; It is very pleasant of
an evening, when we are all assembled together&mdash;which
frequently happens&mdash;and when John and I talk over old times,
and the one interest there has always been between us.</p>
<p>I really do not know, in my Castle, what loneliness is.&nbsp;
Some of our children or grandchildren are always about it, and
the young voices of my descendants are delightful&mdash;O, how
delightful!&mdash;to me to hear.&nbsp; My dearest and most
devoted wife, ever faithful, ever loving, ever helpful and
sustaining and consoling, is the priceless blessing of my house;
from whom all its other blessings spring.&nbsp; We are rather a
musical family, and when Christiana sees me, at any time, a
little weary or depressed, she steals to the piano and sings a
gentle air she used to sing when we were first betrothed.&nbsp;
So weak a man am I, that I cannot bear to hear it from any other
source.&nbsp; They played it once, at the Theatre, when I was
there with Little Frank; and the child said wondering,
&ldquo;Cousin Michael, whose hot tears are these that have fallen
on my hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is my Castle, and such are the real particulars of my
life therein preserved.&nbsp; I often take Little Frank home
there.&nbsp; He is very welcome to my grandchildren, and they
play together.&nbsp; At this time of the year&mdash;the Christmas
and New Year time&mdash;I am seldom out of my Castle.&nbsp; For,
the associations of the season seem to hold me there, and the
precepts of the season seem to teach me that it is well to be
there.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the Castle is&mdash;&rdquo; observed a grave, kind
voice among the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; My Castle,&rdquo; said the poor relation,
shaking his head as he still looked at the fire, &ldquo;is in the
Air.&nbsp; John our esteemed host suggests its situation
accurately.&nbsp; My Castle is in the Air!&nbsp; I have
done.&nbsp; Will you be so good as to pass the story?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>THE
CHILD&rsquo;S STORY.<br />
[1852]</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, a good many years
ago, there was a traveller, and he set out upon a journey.&nbsp;
It was a magic journey, and was to seem very long when he began
it, and very short when he got half way through.</p>
<p>He travelled along a rather dark path for some little time,
without meeting anything, until at last he came to a beautiful
child.&nbsp; So he said to the child, &ldquo;What do you do
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the child said, &ldquo;I am always at
play.&nbsp; Come and play with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, he played with that child, the whole day long, and they
were very merry.&nbsp; The sky was so blue, the sun was so
bright, the water was so sparkling, the leaves were so green, the
flowers were so lovely, and they heard such singing-birds and saw
so many butteries, that everything was beautiful.&nbsp; This was
in fine weather.&nbsp; When it rained, they loved to watch the
falling drops, and to smell the fresh scents.&nbsp; When it blew,
it was delightful to listen to the wind, and fancy what it said,
as it came rushing from its home&mdash;where was that, they
wondered!&mdash;whistling and howling, driving the clouds before
it, bending the trees, rumbling in the chimneys, shaking the
house, and making the sea roar in fury.&nbsp; But, when it
snowed, that was best of all; for, they liked nothing so well as
to look up at the white flakes falling fast and thick, like down
from the breasts of millions of white birds; and to see how
smooth and deep the drift was; and to listen to the hush upon the
paths and roads.</p>
<p>They had plenty of the finest toys in the world, and the most
astonishing picture-books: all about scimitars and slippers and
turbans, and dwarfs and giants and genii and fairies, and
blue-beards and bean-stalks and riches and caverns and forests
and Valentines and Orsons: and all new and all true.</p>
<p>But, one day, of a sudden, the traveller lost the child.&nbsp;
He called to him over and over again, but got no answer.&nbsp;
So, he went upon his road, and went on for a little while without
meeting anything, until at last he came to a handsome boy.&nbsp;
So, he said to the boy, &ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the boy said, &ldquo;I am always learning.&nbsp; Come and
learn with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he learned with that boy about Jupiter and Juno, and the
Greeks and the Romans, and I don&rsquo;t know what, and learned
more than I could tell&mdash;or he either, for he soon forgot a
great deal of it.&nbsp; But, they were not always learning; they
had the merriest games that ever were played.&nbsp; They rowed
upon the river in summer, and skated on the ice in winter; they
were active afoot, and active on horseback; at cricket, and all
games at ball; at prisoner&rsquo;s base, hare and hounds, follow
my leader, and more sports than I can think of; nobody could beat
them.&nbsp; They had holidays too, and Twelfth cakes, and parties
where they danced till midnight, and real Theatres where they saw
palaces of real gold and silver rise out of the real earth, and
saw all the wonders of the world at once.&nbsp; As to friends,
they had such dear friends and so many of them, that I want the
time to reckon them up.&nbsp; They were all young, like the
handsome boy, and were never to be strange to one another all
their lives through.</p>
<p>Still, one day, in the midst of all these pleasures, the
traveller lost the boy as he had lost the child, and, after
calling to him in vain, went on upon his journey.&nbsp; So he
went on for a little while without seeing anything, until at last
he came to a young man.&nbsp; So, he said to the young man,
&ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the young man said,
&ldquo;I am always in love.&nbsp; Come and love with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, he went away with that young man, and presently they came
to one of the prettiest girls that ever was seen&mdash;just like
Fanny in the corner there&mdash;and she had eyes like Fanny, and
hair like Fanny, and dimples like Fanny&rsquo;s, and she laughed
and coloured just as Fanny does while I am talking about
her.&nbsp; So, the young man fell in love directly&mdash;just as
Somebody I won&rsquo;t mention, the first time he came here, did
with Fanny.&nbsp; Well! he was teased sometimes&mdash;just as
Somebody used to be by Fanny; and they quarrelled
sometimes&mdash;just as Somebody and Fanny used to quarrel; and
they made it up, and sat in the dark, and wrote letters every
day, and never were happy asunder, and were always looking out
for one another and pretending not to, and were engaged at
Christmas-time, and sat close to one another by the fire, and
were going to be married very soon&mdash;all exactly like
Somebody I won&rsquo;t mention, and Fanny!</p>
<p>But, the traveller lost them one day, as he had lost the rest
of his friends, and, after calling to them to come back, which
they never did, went on upon his journey.&nbsp; So, he went on
for a little while without seeing anything, until at last he came
to a middle-aged gentleman.&nbsp; So, he said to the gentleman,
&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And his answer was,
&ldquo;I am always busy.&nbsp; Come and be busy with
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, he began to be very busy with that gentleman, and they
went on through the wood together.&nbsp; The whole journey was
through a wood, only it had been open and green at first, like a
wood in spring; and now began to be thick and dark, like a wood
in summer; some of the little trees that had come out earliest,
were even turning brown.&nbsp; The gentleman was not alone, but
had a lady of about the same age with him, who was his Wife; and
they had children, who were with them too.&nbsp; So, they all
went on together through the wood, cutting down the trees, and
making a path through the branches and the fallen leaves, and
carrying burdens, and working hard.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they came to a long green avenue that opened into
deeper woods.&nbsp; Then they would hear a very little, distant
voice crying, &ldquo;Father, father, I am another child!&nbsp;
Stop for me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And presently they would see a very
little figure, growing larger as it came along, running to join
them.&nbsp; When it came up, they all crowded round it, and
kissed and welcomed it; and then they all went on together.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they came to several avenues at once, and then they
all stood still, and one of the children said, &ldquo;Father, I
am going to sea,&rdquo; and another said, &ldquo;Father, I am
going to India,&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;Father, I am going to
seek my fortune where I can,&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;Father, I
am going to Heaven!&rdquo;&nbsp; So, with many tears at parting,
they went, solitary, down those avenues, each child upon its way;
and the child who went to Heaven, rose into the golden air and
vanished.</p>
<p>Whenever these partings happened, the traveller looked at the
gentleman, and saw him glance up at the sky above the trees,
where the day was beginning to decline, and the sunset to come
on.&nbsp; He saw, too, that his hair was turning grey.&nbsp; But,
they never could rest long, for they had their journey to
perform, and it was necessary for them to be always busy.</p>
<p>At last, there had been so many partings that there were no
children left, and only the traveller, the gentleman, and the
lady, went upon their way in company.&nbsp; And now the wood was
yellow; and now brown; and the leaves, even of the forest trees,
began to fall.</p>
<p>So, they came to an avenue that was darker than the rest, and
were pressing forward on their journey without looking down it
when the lady stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; said the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened, and they heard a voice a long way down the
avenue, say, &ldquo;Mother, mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of the first child who had said, &ldquo;I am
going to Heaven!&rdquo; and the father said, &ldquo;I pray not
yet.&nbsp; The sunset is very near.&nbsp; I pray not
yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, the voice cried, &ldquo;Mother, mother!&rdquo; without
minding him, though his hair was now quite white, and tears were
on his face.</p>
<p>Then, the mother, who was already drawn into the shade of the
dark avenue and moving away with her arms still round his neck,
kissed him, and said, &ldquo;My dearest, I am summoned, and I
go!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she was gone.&nbsp; And the traveller and he
were left alone together.</p>
<p>And they went on and on together, until they came to very near
the end of the wood: so near, that they could see the sunset
shining red before them through the trees.</p>
<p>Yet, once more, while he broke his way among the branches, the
traveller lost his friend.&nbsp; He called and called, but there
was no reply, and when he passed out of the wood, and saw the
peaceful sun going down upon a wide purple prospect, he came to
an old man sitting on a fallen tree.&nbsp; So, he said to the old
man, &ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the old man
said with a calm smile, &ldquo;I am always remembering.&nbsp;
Come and remember with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the traveller sat down by the side of that old man, face to
face with the serene sunset; and all his friends came softly back
and stood around him.&nbsp; The beautiful child, the handsome
boy, the young man in love, the father, mother, and children:
every one of them was there, and he had lost nothing.&nbsp; So,
he loved them all, and was kind and forbearing with them all, and
was always pleased to watch them all, and they all honoured and
loved him.&nbsp; And I think the traveller must be yourself, dear
Grandfather, because this what you do to us, and what we do to
you.</p>

SCHOOLBOY&rsquo;S STORY.<br />
[1853]</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> rather young at
present&mdash;I am getting on in years, but still I am rather
young&mdash;I have no particular adventures of my own to fall
back upon.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t much interest anybody here, I
suppose, to know what a screw the Reverend is, or what a griffin
<i>she</i> is, or how they do stick it into
parents&mdash;particularly hair-cutting, and medical
attendance.&nbsp; One of our fellows was charged in his
half&rsquo;s account twelve and sixpence for two
pills&mdash;tolerably profitable at six and threepence a-piece, I
should think&mdash;and he never took them either, but put them up
the sleeve of his jacket.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As to the beef, it&rsquo;s shameful.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
<i>not</i> beef.&nbsp; Regular beef isn&rsquo;t veins.&nbsp; You
can chew regular beef.&nbsp; Besides which, there&rsquo;s gravy
to regular beef, and you never see a drop to ours.&nbsp; Another
of our fellows went home ill, and heard the family doctor tell
his father that he couldn&rsquo;t account for his complaint
unless it was the beer.&nbsp; Of course it was the beer, and well
it might be!</p>
<p>However, beef and Old Cheeseman are two different
things.&nbsp; So is beer.&nbsp; It was Old Cheeseman I meant to
tell about; not the manner in which our fellows get their
constitutions destroyed for the sake of profit.</p>
<p>Why, look at the pie-crust alone.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
flakiness in it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s solid&mdash;like damp
lead.&nbsp; Then our fellows get nightmares, and are bolstered
for calling out and waking other fellows.&nbsp; Who can
wonder!</p>
<p>Old Cheeseman one night walked in his sleep, put his hat on
over his night-cap, got hold of a fishing-rod and a cricket-bat,
and went down into the parlour, where they naturally thought from
his appearance he was a Ghost.&nbsp; Why, he never would have
done that if his meals had been wholesome.&nbsp; When we all
begin to walk in our sleeps, I suppose they&rsquo;ll be sorry for
it.</p>
<p>Old Cheeseman wasn&rsquo;t second Latin Master then; he was a
fellow himself.&nbsp; He was first brought there, very small, in
a post-chaise, by a woman who was always taking snuff and shaking
him&mdash;and that was the most he remembered about it.&nbsp; He
never went home for the holidays.&nbsp; His accounts (he never
learnt any extras) were sent to a Bank, and the Bank paid them;
and he had a brown suit twice a-year, and went into boots at
twelve.&nbsp; They were always too big for him, too.</p>
<p>In the Midsummer holidays, some of our fellows who lived
within walking distance, used to come back and climb the trees
outside the playground wall, on purpose to look at Old Cheeseman
reading there by himself.&nbsp; He was always as mild as the
tea&mdash;and <i>that&rsquo;s</i> pretty mild, I should
hope!&mdash;so when they whistled to him, he looked up and
nodded; and when they said, &ldquo;Halloa, Old Cheeseman, what
have you had for dinner?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Boiled
mutton;&rdquo; and when they said, &ldquo;An&rsquo;t it solitary,
Old Cheeseman?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;It is a little dull
sometimes:&rdquo; and then they said, &ldquo;Well good-bye, Old
Cheeseman!&rdquo; and climbed down again.&nbsp; Of course it was
imposing on Old Cheeseman to give him nothing but boiled mutton
through a whole Vacation, but that was just like the
system.&nbsp; When they didn&rsquo;t give him boiled mutton, they
gave him rice pudding, pretending it was a treat.&nbsp; And saved
the butcher.</p>
<p>So Old Cheeseman went on.&nbsp; The holidays brought him into
other trouble besides the loneliness; because when the fellows
began to come back, not wanting to, he was always glad to see
them; which was aggravating when they were not at all glad to see
him, and so he got his head knocked against walls, and that was
the way his nose bled.&nbsp; But he was a favourite in
general.&nbsp; Once a subscription was raised for him; and, to
keep up his spirits, he was presented before the holidays with
two white mice, a rabbit, a pigeon, and a beautiful puppy.&nbsp;
Old Cheeseman cried about it&mdash;especially soon afterwards,
when they all ate one another.</p>
<p>Of course Old Cheeseman used to be called by the names of all
sorts of cheeses&mdash;Double Glo&rsquo;sterman, Family
Cheshireman, Dutchman, North Wiltshireman, and all that.&nbsp;
But he never minded it.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t mean to say he
was old in point of years&mdash;because he
wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;only he was called from the first, Old
Cheeseman.</p>
<p>At last, Old Cheeseman was made second Latin Master.&nbsp; He
was brought in one morning at the beginning of a new half, and
presented to the school in that capacity as &ldquo;Mr.
Cheeseman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then our fellows all agreed that Old
Cheeseman was a spy, and a deserter, who had gone over to the
enemy&rsquo;s camp, and sold himself for gold.&nbsp; It was no
excuse for him that he had sold himself for very little
gold&mdash;two pound ten a quarter and his washing, as was
reported.&nbsp; It was decided by a Parliament which sat about
it, that Old Cheeseman&rsquo;s mercenary motives could alone be
taken into account, and that he had &ldquo;coined our blood for
drachmas.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Parliament took the expression out of
the quarrel scene between Brutus and Cassius.</p>
<p>When it was settled in this strong way that Old Cheeseman was
a tremendous traitor, who had wormed himself into our
fellows&rsquo; secrets on purpose to get himself into favour by
giving up everything he knew, all courageous fellows were invited
to come forward and enrol themselves in a Society for making a
set against him.&nbsp; The President of the Society was First
boy, named Bob Tarter.&nbsp; His father was in the West Indies,
and he owned, himself, that his father was worth Millions.&nbsp;
He had great power among our fellows, and he wrote a parody,
beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who made believe to be so meek<br />
That we could hardly hear him speak,<br />
Yet turned out an Informing Sneak?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Old Cheeseman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;and on in that way through more than a dozen verses,
which he used to go and sing, every morning, close by the new
master&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp; He trained one of the low boys, too, a
rosy-cheeked little Brass who didn&rsquo;t care what he did, to
go up to him with his Latin Grammar one morning, and say it so:
<i>Nominativus pronominum</i>&mdash;Old Cheeseman, <i>raro
exprimitur</i>&mdash;was never suspected, <i>nisi
distinctionis</i>&mdash;of being an informer, <i>aut emphasis
grat&icirc;a</i>&mdash;until he proved one.&nbsp;
<i>Ut</i>&mdash;for instance, <i>Vos damnastis</i>&mdash;when he
sold the boys.&nbsp; <i>Quasi</i>&mdash;as though,
<i>dicat</i>&mdash;he should say, <i>Pret&aelig;rea
nemo</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;m a Judas!&nbsp; All this produced a great
effect on Old Cheeseman.&nbsp; He had never had much hair; but
what he had, began to get thinner and thinner every day.&nbsp; He
grew paler and more worn; and sometimes of an evening he was seen
sitting at his desk with a precious long snuff to his candle, and
his hands before his face, crying.&nbsp; But no member of the
Society could pity him, even if he felt inclined, because the
President said it was Old Cheeseman&rsquo;s conscience.</p>
<p>So Old Cheeseman went on, and didn&rsquo;t he lead a miserable
life!&nbsp; Of course the Reverend turned up his nose at him, and
of course <i>she</i> did&mdash;because both of them always do
that at all the masters&mdash;but he suffered from the fellows
most, and he suffered from them constantly.&nbsp; He never told
about it, that the Society could find out; but he got no credit
for that, because the President said it was Old Cheeseman&rsquo;s
cowardice.</p>
<p>He had only one friend in the world, and that one was almost
as powerless as he was, for it was only Jane.&nbsp; Jane was a
sort of wardrobe woman to our fellows, and took care of the
boxes.&nbsp; She had come at first, I believe, as a kind of
apprentice&mdash;some of our fellows say from a Charity, but
<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and after her time was out, had
stopped at so much a year.&nbsp; So little a year, perhaps I
ought to say, for it is far more likely.&nbsp; However, she had
put some pounds in the Savings&rsquo; Bank, and she was a very
nice young woman.&nbsp; She was not quite pretty; but she had a
very frank, honest, bright face, and all our fellows were fond of
her.&nbsp; She was uncommonly neat and cheerful, and uncommonly
comfortable and kind.&nbsp; And if anything was the matter with a
fellow&rsquo;s mother, he always went and showed the letter to
Jane.</p>
<p>Jane was Old Cheeseman&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; The more the
Society went against him, the more Jane stood by him.&nbsp; She
used to give him a good-humoured look out of her still-room
window, sometimes, that seemed to set him up for the day.&nbsp;
She used to pass out of the orchard and the kitchen garden
(always kept locked, I believe you!) through the playground, when
she might have gone the other way, only to give a turn of her
head, as much as to say &ldquo;Keep up your spirits!&rdquo; to
Old Cheeseman.&nbsp; His slip of a room was so fresh and orderly
that it was well known who looked after it while he was at his
desk; and when our fellows saw a smoking hot dumpling on his
plate at dinner, they knew with indignation who had sent it
up.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Society resolved, after a
quantity of meeting and debating, that Jane should be requested
to cut Old Cheeseman dead; and that if she refused, she must be
sent to Coventry herself.&nbsp; So a deputation, headed by the
President, was appointed to wait on Jane, and inform her of the
vote the Society had been under the painful necessity of
passing.&nbsp; She was very much respected for all her good
qualities, and there was a story about her having once waylaid
the Reverend in his own study, and got a fellow off from severe
punishment, of her own kind comfortable heart.&nbsp; So the
deputation didn&rsquo;t much like the job.&nbsp; However, they
went up, and the President told Jane all about it.&nbsp; Upon
which Jane turned very red, burst into tears, informed the
President and the deputation, in a way not at all like her usual
way, that they were a parcel of malicious young savages, and
turned the whole respected body out of the room.&nbsp;
Consequently it was entered in the Society&rsquo;s book (kept in
astronomical cypher for fear of detection), that all
communication with Jane was interdicted: and the President
addressed the members on this convincing instance of Old
Cheeseman&rsquo;s undermining.</p>
<p>But Jane was as true to Old Cheeseman as Old Cheeseman was
false to our fellows&mdash;in their opinion, at all
events&mdash;and steadily continued to be his only friend.&nbsp;
It was a great exasperation to the Society, because Jane was as
much a loss to them as she was a gain to him; and being more
inveterate against him than ever, they treated him worse than
ever.&nbsp; At last, one morning, his desk stood empty, his room
was peeped into, and found to be vacant, and a whisper went about
among the pale faces of our fellows that Old Cheeseman, unable to
bear it any longer, had got up early and drowned himself.</p>
<p>The mysterious looks of the other masters after breakfast, and
the evident fact that old Cheeseman was not expected, confirmed
the Society in this opinion.&nbsp; Some began to discuss whether
the President was liable to hanging or only transportation for
life, and the President&rsquo;s face showed a great anxiety to
know which.&nbsp; However, he said that a jury of his country
should find him game; and that in his address he should put it to
them to lay their hands upon their hearts and say whether they as
Britons approved of informers, and how they thought they would
like it themselves.&nbsp; Some of the Society considered that he
had better run away until he found a forest where he might change
clothes with a wood-cutter, and stain his face with blackberries;
but the majority believed that if he stood his ground, his
father&mdash;belonging as he did to the West Indies, and being
worth millions&mdash;could buy him off.</p>
<p>All our fellows&rsquo; hearts beat fast when the Reverend came
in, and made a sort of a Roman, or a Field Marshal, of himself
with the ruler; as he always did before delivering an
address.&nbsp; But their fears were nothing to their astonishment
when he came out with the story that Old Cheeseman, &ldquo;so
long our respected friend and fellow-pilgrim in the pleasant
plains of knowledge,&rdquo; he called him&mdash;O yes!&nbsp; I
dare say!&nbsp; Much of that!&mdash;was the orphan child of a
disinherited young lady who had married against her
father&rsquo;s wish, and whose young husband had died, and who
had died of sorrow herself, and whose unfortunate baby (Old
Cheeseman) had been brought up at the cost of a grandfather who
would never consent to see it, baby, boy, or man: which
grandfather was now dead, and serve him right&mdash;that&rsquo;s
my putting in&mdash;and which grandfather&rsquo;s large property,
there being no will, was now, and all of a sudden and for ever,
Old Cheeseman&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Our so long respected friend and
fellow-pilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge, the Reverend
wound up a lot of bothering quotations by saying, would
&ldquo;come among us once more&rdquo; that day fortnight, when he
desired to take leave of us himself, in a more particular
manner.&nbsp; With these words, he stared severely round at our
fellows, and went solemnly out.</p>
<p>There was precious consternation among the members of the
Society, now.&nbsp; Lots of them wanted to resign, and lots more
began to try to make out that they had never belonged to
it.&nbsp; However, the President stuck up, and said that they
must stand or fall together, and that if a breach was made it
should be over his body&mdash;which was meant to encourage the
Society: but it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The President further said,
he would consider the position in which they stood, and would
give them his best opinion and advice in a few days.&nbsp; This
was eagerly looked for, as he knew a good deal of the world on
account of his father&rsquo;s being in the West Indies.</p>
<p>After days and days of hard thinking, and drawing armies all
over his slate, the President called our fellows together, and
made the matter clear.&nbsp; He said it was plain that when Old
Cheeseman came on the appointed day, his first revenge would be
to impeach the Society, and have it flogged all round.&nbsp;
After witnessing with joy the torture of his enemies, and
gloating over the cries which agony would extort from them, the
probability was that he would invite the Reverend, on pretence of
conversation, into a private room&mdash;say the parlour into
which Parents were shown, where the two great globes were which
were never used&mdash;and would there reproach him with the
various frauds and oppressions he had endured at his hands.&nbsp;
At the close of his observations he would make a signal to a
Prizefighter concealed in the passage, who would then appear and
pitch into the Reverend, till he was left insensible.&nbsp; Old
Cheeseman would then make Jane a present of from five to ten
pounds, and would leave the establishment in fiendish
triumph.</p>
<p>The President explained that against the parlour part, or the
Jane part, of these arrangements he had nothing to say; but, on
the part of the Society, he counselled deadly resistance.&nbsp;
With this view he recommended that all available desks should be
filled with stones, and that the first word of the complaint
should be the signal to every fellow to let fly at Old
Cheeseman.&nbsp; The bold advice put the Society in better
spirits, and was unanimously taken.&nbsp; A post about Old
Cheeseman&rsquo;s size was put up in the playground, and all our
fellows practised at it till it was dinted all over.</p>
<p>When the day came, and Places were called, every fellow sat
down in a tremble.&nbsp; There had been much discussing and
disputing as to how Old Cheeseman would come; but it was the
general opinion that he would appear in a sort of triumphal car
drawn by four horses, with two livery servants in front, and the
Prizefighter in disguise up behind.&nbsp; So, all our fellows sat
listening for the sound of wheels.&nbsp; But no wheels were
heard, for Old Cheeseman walked after all, and came into the
school without any preparation.&nbsp; Pretty much as he used to
be, only dressed in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Reverend, presenting him,
&ldquo;our so long respected friend and fellow-pilgrim in the
pleasant plains of knowledge, is desirous to offer a word or
two.&nbsp; Attention, gentlemen, one and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every fellow stole his hand into his desk and looked at the
President.&nbsp; The President was all ready, and taking aim at
old Cheeseman with his eyes.</p>
<p>What did Old Cheeseman then, but walk up to his old desk, look
round him with a queer smile as if there was a tear in his eye,
and begin in a quavering, mild voice, &ldquo;My dear companions
and old friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every fellow&rsquo;s hand came out of his desk, and the
President suddenly began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear companions and old friends,&rdquo; said Old
Cheeseman, &ldquo;you have heard of my good fortune.&nbsp; I have
passed so many years under this roof&mdash;my entire life so far,
I may say&mdash;that I hope you have been glad to hear of it for
my sake.&nbsp; I could never enjoy it without exchanging
congratulations with you.&nbsp; If we have ever misunderstood one
another at all, pray, my dear boys, let us forgive and
forget.&nbsp; I have a great tenderness for you, and I am sure
you return it.&nbsp; I want in the fulness of a grateful heart to
shake hands with you every one.&nbsp; I have come back to do it,
if you please, my dear boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the President had begun to cry, several other fellows
had broken out here and there: but now, when Old Cheeseman began
with him as first boy, laid his left hand affectionately on his
shoulder and gave him his right; and when the President said
&ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t deserve it, sir; upon my honour I
don&rsquo;t;&rdquo; there was sobbing and crying all over the
school.&nbsp; Every other fellow said he didn&rsquo;t deserve it,
much in the same way; but Old Cheeseman, not minding that a bit,
went cheerfully round to every boy, and wound up with every
master&mdash;finishing off the Reverend last.</p>
<p>Then a snivelling little chap in a corner, who was always
under some punishment or other, set up a shrill cry of
&ldquo;Success to Old Cheeseman!&nbsp; Hooray!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Reverend glared upon him, and said, &ldquo;<i>Mr.</i> Cheeseman,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, Old Cheeseman protesting that he liked his
old name a great deal better than his new one, all our fellows
took up the cry; and, for I don&rsquo;t know how many minutes,
there was such a thundering of feet and hands, and such a roaring
of Old Cheeseman, as never was heard.</p>
<p>After that, there was a spread in the dining-room of the most
magnificent kind.&nbsp; Fowls, tongues, preserves, fruits,
confectionaries, jellies, neguses, barley-sugar temples, trifles,
crackers&mdash;eat all you can and pocket what you like&mdash;all
at Old Cheeseman&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; After that, speeches,
whole holiday, double and treble sets of all manners of things
for all manners of games, donkeys, pony-chaises and drive
yourself, dinner for all the masters at the Seven Bells (twenty
pounds a-head our fellows estimated it at), an annual holiday and
feast fixed for that day every year, and another on Old
Cheeseman&rsquo;s birthday&mdash;Reverend bound down before the
fellows to allow it, so that he could never back out&mdash;all at
Old Cheeseman&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t our fellows go down in a body and cheer
outside the Seven Bells?&nbsp; O no!</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something else besides.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
look at the next story-teller, for there&rsquo;s more yet.&nbsp;
Next day, it was resolved that the Society should make it up with
Jane, and then be dissolved.&nbsp; What do you think of Jane
being gone, though!&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&nbsp; Gone for
ever?&rdquo; said our fellows, with long faces.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
to be sure,&rdquo; was all the answer they could get.&nbsp; None
of the people about the house would say anything more.&nbsp; At
length, the first boy took upon himself to ask the Reverend
whether our old friend Jane was really gone?&nbsp; The Reverend
(he has got a daughter at home&mdash;turn-up nose, and red)
replied severely, &ldquo;Yes, sir, Miss Pitt is
gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of calling Jane, Miss Pitt!&nbsp;
Some said she had been sent away in disgrace for taking money
from Old Cheeseman; others said she had gone into Old
Cheeseman&rsquo;s service at a rise of ten pounds a year.&nbsp;
All that our fellows knew, was, she was gone.</p>
<p>It was two or three months afterwards, when, one afternoon, an
open carriage stopped at the cricket field, just outside bounds,
with a lady and gentleman in it, who looked at the game a long
time and stood up to see it played.&nbsp; Nobody thought much
about them, until the same little snivelling chap came in,
against all rules, from the post where he was Scout, and said,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jane!&rdquo;&nbsp; Both Elevens forgot the game
directly, and ran crowding round the carriage.&nbsp; It
<i>was</i> Jane!&nbsp; In such a bonnet!&nbsp; And if
you&rsquo;ll believe me, Jane was married to Old Cheeseman.</p>
<p>It soon became quite a regular thing when our fellows were
hard at it in the playground, to see a carriage at the low part
of the wall where it joins the high part, and a lady and
gentleman standing up in it, looking over.&nbsp; The gentleman
was always Old Cheeseman, and the lady was always Jane.</p>
<p>The first time I ever saw them, I saw them in that way.&nbsp;
There had been a good many changes among our fellows then, and it
had turned out that Bob Tarter&rsquo;s father wasn&rsquo;t worth
Millions!&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t worth anything.&nbsp; Bob had
gone for a soldier, and Old Cheeseman had purchased his
discharge.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not the carriage.&nbsp; The
carriage stopped, and all our fellows stopped as soon as it was
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have never sent me to Coventry after all!&rdquo;
said the lady, laughing, as our fellows swarmed up the wall to
shake hands with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you never going to do
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! never! never!&rdquo; on all sides.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand what she meant then, but of course I
do now.&nbsp; I was very much pleased with her face though, and
with her good way, and I couldn&rsquo;t help looking at
her&mdash;and at him too&mdash;with all our fellows clustering so
joyfully about them.</p>
<p>They soon took notice of me as a new boy, so I thought I might
as well swarm up the wall myself, and shake hands with them as
the rest did.&nbsp; I was quite as glad to see them as the rest
were, and was quite as familiar with them in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a fortnight now,&rdquo; said Old Cheeseman,
&ldquo;to the holidays.&nbsp; Who stops?&nbsp;
Anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good many fingers pointed at me, and a good many voices
cried &ldquo;He does!&rdquo;&nbsp; For it was the year when you
were all away; and rather low I was about it, I can tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Old Cheeseman.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s solitary here in the holiday time.&nbsp; He had better
come to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I went to their delightful house, and was as happy as I
could possibly be.&nbsp; They understand how to conduct
themselves towards boys, <i>they</i> do.&nbsp; When they take a
boy to the play, for instance, they <i>do</i> take him.&nbsp;
They don&rsquo;t go in after it&rsquo;s begun, or come out before
it&rsquo;s over.&nbsp; They know how to bring a boy up,
too.&nbsp; Look at their own!&nbsp; Though he is very little as
yet, what a capital boy he is!&nbsp; Why, my next favourite to
Mrs. Cheeseman and Old Cheeseman, is young Cheeseman.</p>
<p>So, now I have told you all I know about Old Cheeseman.&nbsp;
And it&rsquo;s not much after all, I am afraid.&nbsp; Is it?</p>

69</span>NOBODY&rsquo;S STORY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> lived on the bank of a mighty
river, broad and deep, which was always silently rolling on to a
vast undiscovered ocean.&nbsp; It had rolled on, ever since the
world began.&nbsp; It had changed its course sometimes, and
turned into new channels, leaving its old ways dry and barren;
but it had ever been upon the flow, and ever was to flow until
Time should be no more.&nbsp; Against its strong, unfathomable
stream, nothing made head.&nbsp; No living creature, no flower,
no leaf, no particle of animate or inanimate existence, ever
strayed back from the undiscovered ocean.&nbsp; The tide of the
river set resistlessly towards it; and the tide never stopped,
any more than the earth stops in its circling round the sun.</p>
<p>He lived in a busy place, and he worked very hard to
live.&nbsp; He had no hope of ever being rich enough to live a
month without hard work, but he was quite content, GOD knows, to
labour with a cheerful will.&nbsp; He was one of an immense
family, all of whose sons and daughters gained their daily bread
by daily work, prolonged from their rising up betimes until their
lying down at night.&nbsp; Beyond this destiny he had no
prospect, and he sought none.</p>
<p>There was over-much drumming, trumpeting, and speech-making,
in the neighbourhood where he dwelt; but he had nothing to do
with that.&nbsp; Such clash and uproar came from the Bigwig
family, at the unaccountable proceedings of which race, he
marvelled much.&nbsp; They set up the strangest statues, in iron,
marble, bronze, and brass, before his door; and darkened his
house with the legs and tails of uncouth images of horses.&nbsp;
He wondered what it all meant, smiled in a rough good-humoured
way he had, and kept at his hard work.</p>
<p>The Bigwig family (composed of all the stateliest people
thereabouts, and all the noisiest) had undertaken to save him the
trouble of thinking for himself, and to manage him and his
affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why truly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have
little time upon my hands; and if you will be so good as to take
care of me, in return for the money I pay over&rdquo;&mdash;for
the Bigwig family were not above his money&mdash;&ldquo;I shall
be relieved and much obliged, considering that you know
best.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence the drumming, trumpeting, and
speech-making, and the ugly images of horses which he was
expected to fall down and worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand all this,&rdquo; said he,
rubbing his furrowed brow confusedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it
<i>has</i> a meaning, maybe, if I could find it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; returned the Bigwig family, suspecting
something of what he said, &ldquo;honour and glory in the
highest, to the highest merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And he was glad to hear
that.</p>
<p>But, when he looked among the images in iron, marble, bronze,
and brass, he failed to find a rather meritorious countryman of
his, once the son of a Warwickshire wool-dealer, or any single
countryman whomsoever of that kind.&nbsp; He could find none of
the men whose knowledge had rescued him and his children from
terrific and disfiguring disease, whose boldness had raised his
forefathers from the condition of serfs, whose wise fancy had
opened a new and high existence to the humblest, whose skill had
filled the working man&rsquo;s world with accumulated
wonders.&nbsp; Whereas, he did find others whom he knew no good
of, and even others whom he knew much ill of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, he went home, and sat down by his fireside to get it out
of his mind.</p>
<p>Now, his fireside was a bare one, all hemmed in by blackened
streets; but it was a precious place to him.&nbsp; The hands of
his wife were hardened with toil, and she was old before her
time; but she was dear to him.&nbsp; His children, stunted in
their growth, bore traces of unwholesome nurture; but they had
beauty in his sight.&nbsp; Above all other things, it was an
earnest desire of this man&rsquo;s soul that his children should
be taught.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I am sometimes misled,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;for want of knowledge, at least let them know better, and
avoid my mistakes.&nbsp; If it is hard to me to reap the harvest
of pleasure and instruction that is stored in books, let it be
easier to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, the Bigwig family broke out into violent family quarrels
concerning what it was lawful to teach to this man&rsquo;s
children.&nbsp; Some of the family insisted on such a thing being
primary and indispensable above all other things; and others of
the family insisted on such another thing being primary and
indispensable above all other things; and the Bigwig family, rent
into factions, wrote pamphlets, held convocations, delivered
charges, orations, and all varieties of discourses; impounded one
another in courts Lay and courts Ecclesiastical; threw dirt,
exchanged pummelings, and fell together by the ears in
unintelligible animosity.&nbsp; Meanwhile, this man, in his short
evening snatches at his fireside, saw the demon Ignorance arise
there, and take his children to itself.&nbsp; He saw his daughter
perverted into a heavy, slatternly drudge; he saw his son go
moping down the ways of low sensuality, to brutality and crime;
he saw the dawning light of intelligence in the eyes of his
babies so changing into cunning and suspicion, that he could have
rather wished them idiots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this any the better,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;but I think it cannot be right.&nbsp; Nay, by the
clouded Heaven above me, I protest against this as my
wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Becoming peaceable again (for his passion was usually
short-lived, and his nature kind), he looked about him on his
Sundays and holidays, and he saw how much monotony and weariness
there was, and thence how drunkenness arose with all its train of
ruin.&nbsp; Then he appealed to the Bigwig family, and said,
&ldquo;We are a labouring people, and I have a glimmering
suspicion in me that labouring people of whatever condition were
made&mdash;by a higher intelligence than yours, as I poorly
understand it&mdash;to be in need of mental refreshment and
recreation.&nbsp; See what we fall into, when we rest without
it.&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; Amuse me harmlessly, show me something,
give me an escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, here the Bigwig family fell into a state of uproar
absolutely deafening.&nbsp; When some few voices were faintly
heard, proposing to show him the wonders of the world, the
greatness of creation, the mighty changes of time, the workings
of nature and the beauties of art&mdash;to show him these things,
that is to say, at any period of his life when he could look upon
them&mdash;there arose among the Bigwigs such roaring and raving,
such pulpiting and petitioning, such maundering and
memorialising, such name-calling and dirt-throwing, such a shrill
wind of parliamentary questioning and feeble replying&mdash;where
&ldquo;I dare not&rdquo; waited on &ldquo;I
would&rdquo;&mdash;that the poor fellow stood aghast, staring
wildly around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I provoked all this,&rdquo; said he, with his
hands to his affrighted ears, &ldquo;by what was meant to be an
innocent request, plainly arising out of my familiar experience,
and the common knowledge of all men who choose to open their
eyes?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand, and I am not
understood.&nbsp; What is to come of such a state of
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was bending over his work, often asking himself the
question, when the news began to spread that a pestilence had
appeared among the labourers, and was slaying them by
thousands.&nbsp; Going forth to look about him, he soon found
this to be true.&nbsp; The dying and the dead were mingled in the
close and tainted houses among which his life was passed.&nbsp;
New poison was distilled into the always murky, always sickening
air.&nbsp; The robust and the weak, old age and infancy, the
father and the mother, all were stricken down alike.</p>
<p>What means of flight had he?&nbsp; He remained there, where he
was, and saw those who were dearest to him die.&nbsp; A kind
preacher came to him, and would have said some prayers to soften
his heart in his gloom, but he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O what avails it, missionary, to come to me, a man
condemned to residence in this foetid place, where every sense
bestowed upon me for my delight becomes a torment, and where
every minute of my numbered days is new mire added to the heap
under which I lie oppressed!&nbsp; But, give me my first glimpse
of Heaven, through a little of its light and air; give me pure
water; help me to be clean; lighten this heavy atmosphere and
heavy life, in which our spirits sink, and we become the
indifferent and callous creatures you too often see us; gently
and kindly take the bodies of those who die among us, out of the
small room where we grow to be so familiar with the awful change
that even its sanctity is lost to us; and, Teacher, then I will
hear&mdash;none know better than you, how willingly&mdash;of Him
whose thoughts were so much with the poor, and who had compassion
for all human sorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was at work again, solitary and sad, when his Master came
and stood near to him dressed in black.&nbsp; He, also, had
suffered heavily.&nbsp; His young wife, his beautiful and good
young wife, was dead; so, too, his only child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, &rsquo;tis hard to bear&mdash;I know
it&mdash;but be comforted.&nbsp; I would give you comfort, if I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Master thanked him from his heart, but, said he, &ldquo;O
you labouring men!&nbsp; The calamity began among you.&nbsp; If
you had but lived more healthily and decently, I should not be
the widowed and bereft mourner that I am this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; returned the other, shaking his head,
&ldquo;I have begun to understand a little that most calamities
will come from us, as this one did, and that none will stop at
our poor doors, until we are united with that great squabbling
family yonder, to do the things that are right.&nbsp; We cannot
live healthily and decently, unless they who undertook to manage
us provide the means.&nbsp; We cannot be instructed unless they
will teach us; we cannot be rationally amused, unless they will
amuse us; we cannot but have some false gods of our own, while
they set up so many of theirs in all the public places.&nbsp; The
evil consequences of imperfect instruction, the evil consequences
of pernicious neglect, the evil consequences of unnatural
restraint and the denial of humanising enjoyments, will all come
from us, and none of them will stop with us.&nbsp; They will
spread far and wide.&nbsp; They always do; they always have
done&mdash;just like the pestilence.&nbsp; I understand so much,
I think, at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Master said again, &ldquo;O you labouring men!&nbsp;
How seldom do we ever hear of you, except in connection with some
trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am Nobody, and
little likely to be heard of (nor yet much wanted to be heard of,
perhaps), except when there is some trouble.&nbsp; But it never
begins with me, and it never can end with me.&nbsp; As sure as
Death, it comes down to me, and it goes up from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was so much reason in what he said, that the Bigwig
family, getting wind of it, and being horribly frightened by the
late desolation, resolved to unite with him to do the things that
were right&mdash;at all events, so far as the said things were
associated with the direct prevention, humanly speaking, of
another pestilence.&nbsp; But, as their fear wore off, which it
soon began to do, they resumed their falling out among
themselves, and did nothing.&nbsp; Consequently the scourge
appeared again&mdash;low down as before&mdash;and spread
avengingly upward as before, and carried off vast numbers of the
brawlers.&nbsp; But not a man among them ever admitted, if in the
least degree he ever perceived, that he had anything to do with
it.</p>
<p>So Nobody lived and died in the old, old, old way; and this,
in the main, is the whole of Nobody&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Had he no name, you ask?&nbsp; Perhaps it was Legion.&nbsp; It
matters little what his name was.&nbsp; Let us call him
Legion.</p>
<p>If you were ever in the Belgian villages near the field of
Waterloo, you will have seen, in some quiet little church, a
monument erected by faithful companions in arms to the memory of
Colonel A, Major B, Captains C, D and E, Lieutenants F and G,
Ensigns H, I and J, seven non-commissioned officers, and one
hundred and thirty rank and file, who fell in the discharge of
their duty on the memorable day.&nbsp; The story of Nobody is the
story of the rank and file of the earth.&nbsp; They bear their
share of the battle; they have their part in the victory; they
fall; they leave no name but in the mass.&nbsp; The march of the
proudest of us, leads to the dusty way by which they go.&nbsp;
O!&nbsp; Let us think of them this year at the Christmas fire,
and not forget them when it is burnt out.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
